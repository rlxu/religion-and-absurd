Religion and the Absurd:

A Skeptic’s View of Judaeo-Christian Scripture and Tradition

Introduction:

Having been raised as a Catholic, I was aghast when, as a grade-schooler who took my faith very seriously, I was told that the prohibition on eating meat on Fridays had been lifted. What?! Can they do that?! Says who?! After that, the holy cows starting falling like snowflakes: the Mass was now to be in English, and breakfast could be taken before communion! Where would it end? And where did all those rules come from in the first place? Slowly I began to realize that they were invented by old priests in an incense-filled room. That’s when I started to question everything else. Having made the fateful decision to read the Bible myself, I became ever more dubious as to the authority and intentions of churches and religion in general.

In order that other persons of an open mind might make informed decisions regarding religion, I have documented some of my surprising discoveries, such as that Jesus and Paul differed widely on the qualifications for salvation, and that churches, in self-interest, chose Paul over Jesus and his brother James.

People, however, will believe what they want to believe, evidence notwithstanding, so I don’t expect to change anyone’s mind. I am resigned to being both misread and condemned by the same self-interested church zealots who threw over Jesus for Paul. If, though, you are of an open mind, please peruse these articles and come to your own conclusions.

The articles are divided into four sections: first, a chronological investigation of religious views of Scripture; second, an investigation of the real and mythical Jesus with selections from the Gospel according to Matthew; third, an analysis of motives for belief; and fourth, a list of apocalyptic (need I say, incorrect) predictions of the end of the world.

These articles are the fruit of a collective effort and remain so. I take responsibility for compiling and editing the contributions. If someone has an insight into one of the subjects treated herein or feels a mistake has been made, please enlighten us.

Definitions:

Religion - a set of doctrines which requires faith in metaphysical phenomena (i.e., gods, miracles, afterlife, power of prayer, etc.). If a set of doctrines does not require faith, then it does not qualify as a religion, but only as a philosophy. Many religions claim a mutually exclusive right to Truth - they maintain that their religion is right, and all others are wrong - while others are more inclusive.

The Absurd - a phenomenon which defies reasonable explanation.

Soeren Kierkegaard (hereafter K), whose Fear and Trembling posits acceptance of the Absurd as prerequisite for faith, uses the example of Abraham’s unquestioning resolve to kill his son Isaac based only upon the command of a voice in his head that he identified as God. K considers this action Absurd because it defies logic and social custom. Christian dogma, according to K, embodies paradoxes which are offensive to reason. (Indeed, were someone today to say that he intended to kill his child because a voice in his head had instructed him to, we too might react with Fear and Trembling!) There are two attitudes one can adopt to this assertion: viz., one can take K’s leap of faith and believe, or one can doubt. What one may not do, according to K, is have faith by virtue of reason. If one chooses faith, one must suspend reason. In fact one must believe by virtue of the Absurd.

K notwithstanding, A rational individual should apply the same objectivity to her own beliefs as she would to those of another, for who would not agree that the believers in other gods are wrong?

Spirituality or Religion? I personally am not an atheist - it seems self-evident to me that there is something behind the wondrous universe in which we live, and that intuitive knowledge can lead to insights into its nature - but I am wary of pre-scientific legends that later claim factual credibility (inerrancy). I object to the presentation of religion as based in fact and science, and I feel there is copious evidence that exposes these stories as myth or legend. I have, however, included rebuttals to my assertions and I welcome readers to offer their own rebuttals where they think I have erred.

Religion performs useful social functions and is cherished by a great many people, but is also responsible for enormous monstrosities in human history. Like a rifle which may be used either for hunting and for personal protection or for mass murder, so religion in the right hands may be a productive element in society, but in the wrong hands a powerful destructive force. Perhaps the greatest flaws in religion are that it teaches people from earliest youth to reject objectivity and to blindly follow fairy tales, and that it depersonalizes judgment so that, for example, an otherwise civilized person might kill his own child on a whim.

Evolution of the Relationship between Religion and Science

1. The Primitive Period

In the beginning, all was mysterious, terrifying, and wonderful. Man did not understand the origin of earthquakes, lightning, or how the sun got from the west back to the east for sunrise the next morning. Why did plants grow? Why did people get sick and die? People were desperate for answers, which they found according to what seemed most reasonable. Wherever a phenomenon defied natural explanation, some supernatural agency was presumed. Further, people desperately wanted to be able to control these phenomena and so instituted sacrifices and prayers in the belief that these actions could influence the appropriate deities. At this point religion and science were synonymous.

2.The Growth of Science As knowledge of the physical world increasingly showed non-spiritual causes of phenomena, entrenched religious authorities threatened with a diminution in the scope of their influence reacted forcefully against the “impious” assertions of secular knowledge.

3.The  Current State of Affairs As science continues to advance our understanding of the world and ourselves, the original rationale for religion itself is progressively undermined. Confronted with refutations of core beliefs, religionists have responded in a variety of ways: some modify their beliefs to accommodate science, while some seek alternate realities. Even science has been posited as a religion of sorts by some apologists of faith. In some cases, the entrenched interests of organized religion and social conservatism have instituted a war against science itself and the public schools that bring unwelcome ideas into their communities.

4. The persistence of superstition (i.e., faith, prayer, miracles, etc.)

Why do parents encourage their children to

believe in obvious falsehoods: Santa Claus, turning water to wine, the “Virgin” Mary, the gift of tongues? Why do people persist in the belief that prayers are efficacious? Did the people whose house was hit by the tornado not pray hard enough? Besides, isn’t a prayer simply a request that God change his Divine Plan in order to accommodate one’s personal desire? Isn’t it a rejection of “thy will be done”? We will investigate these questions below.

Part One - A Chronological Consideration of Judaeo-Christian Theology

Historical Overview of pre-Christian Israel:

The history of the Hebrew people is well documented by outside sources (Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Persia, Greece, Rome) as well as by Jewish historians and Scripture. Absent the mythology, what seems most likely is that the Hebrews migrated from Mesopotamia to the highlands of Canaan around 1700 BCE, and brought with them numerous religious myths. Around the time of Solomon these stories were crystallized in the Scripture by authors known as J (Jehovist) and E (Elohist), with later additions by D (Deuteronomist), Chron (icler), Prophets, and P (Priests).

David’s kingdom then split into Samaria (Israel) in the north, with a temple at Shiloh served by Aaronite priests; and Judea in the south, with a temple at Jerusalem served by Zadokite priests. There was widespread on-going polytheistic worship of El, Baal, and Asherah, as well as an incipient monotheism centered on YHWH (Jehovah), the newly enshrined war-god of Judea. Judean Prophets soon emerged who demanded exclusive worship of YHWH, and their warnings of the dangers of inclusive Yahwism (worship of other gods along with YHWH) seemed vindicated when Samaria fell to Assyria in 722 BCE. At this point D rewrites Scripture to prophesy the fall of Samaria, perpetual Davidic kingship, etc.

In 586 BCE, though, faith in YHWH was tested when Jerusalem was conquered and the Temple destroyed by Babylonians. Judean leaders and priests were removed to Babylon (Babylonian Exile), during which time they retooled their theology to account for what had happened. They concluded that YHWH was punishing them for apostasy (allowing the worship of Baal and Asherah - El had already been assimilated into   YHWH)  and   genealogical   impurity (intermarriage with the

“unclean” Canaanite

women). Their history was rewritten by P and Chron to emphasize the myths of Moses, the Exodus, and a mythic conquest of Canaan.

When they returned to Palestine with their new Scriptures and genealogies in hand, these Babylonian exiles reclaimed “their” land and imposed a harsh, xenophobic regime of exclusive Yahwism. Scripture had been rewritten by these Judean exilic returnees, so it is small wonder that exclusive Yahwism predominates in Scripture at the expense of northern, Samarian inclusivity.

This did not lead to the liberation of Judea from foreign domination, however. The Babylonians were followed by the Persians with their Zoroastrian dualism, and then the Greeks, who offered a sophisticated individualistic philosophy and a cosmopolitan worldview that appealed to many affluent Jews. This threat was met by further xenophobic isolation and a stronger sense of identification with mythic Tradition. The failure of their piety to liberate them from foreign domination, encouraged by Zoroastrian dualism, finally led to the theology of Apocalypticism - the belief present both in Daniel and the Gospels - that we are living in an age dominated by evil that can only be saved by direct, imminent divine intervention.

Adam and Eve

Exactly why were Adam and Eve expelled from the Garden of Eden? It’s probably not why you think. The evidence strongly suggests that this story was intended as a myth: a man named Man, a woman named Woman, and a talking snake. (All citations are from the King James Version):

Genesis 2:15 And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.

16 And the LORD God

commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: 17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die. …3:1 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? 2 And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:

3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. 4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: 5 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. 6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat. 7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons. 8 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden. 9 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou? 10 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself. 11 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat? 12 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat. 13 And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat. … 22 And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever: 23 Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken. 24 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.

So Adam and Eve didn’t die the day they ate the fruit, as God had said they would; they could have lived forever, had they eaten the fruit of the Tree of Life; and after they had become as gods God banished them from Eden to prevent their immortality. Not the Sunday school version.

Noah’s Ark

In the story of the Flood, P (the Priestly source) and J (the Yahwist source) differ in the number of animals to be brought onboard, and how long the flood lasted. Here the two stories are separated: “P” Flood Numbers 6:19 And of every living thing of all flesh, two</span><span class="cls_003"> of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep</span></div them alive with thee; they shall be male and female. 20 Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two</span><span class="cls_003"> of every sort shall come unto thee,</span></div to keep them alive...7:11 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the</span></div seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and</span></div the windows of heaven were opened. 24 And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and</span></div fifty days… 8:3 and after the end of the </span><span class="cls_022">hundred and fifty days</span><span class="cls_003"> the waters were abated. 4 And the</span></div ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat. 5 And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen. 13 And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: 14 And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was</span></div the earth dried.  (=376 days)</span></div

“J” Flood Numbers</span></div

7:2 Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens</span><span class="cls_003">, the male and his female: and of</span></div beasts that are not clean by two</span><span class="cls_003">, the male and his</span></div female. 3 Of fowls also of the air by sevens,</span><span class="cls_003"> the</span></div male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth. 4 For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days</span></div and forty nights… 8:6 And it came to pass at</span></div the end of forty days,</span><span class="cls_003"> that Noah opened the</span></div window of the ark which he had made:

7 And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth. 8 Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground; 9 But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark. 10 And he stayed yet other seven days</span><span class="cls_003">; and again he sent</span></div forth the dove out of the ark; 11 And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth. 12 And he stayed yet other seven days</span><span class="cls_003">; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any</span></div more. 13… and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the</span></div ground was dry. (= 61 days, calculating seven days after the raven, because in verse 10 he says</span></div “other” = “another” seven days; otherwise, 54 days.)

Rebuttal: The mediaeval Jewish commentator, Rashi, explains that what scripture means is

that a pair of all “unclean” - ritually impure - animals is meant and 7 pair of ritually “clean” animals.

The Joseph Story

Even more noteworthy is the weaving together of the J (southern Yahwist source) and E (the northern Elohist source) strands of the Joseph story, in which the two diverge markedly. Note that the southern source prefers Judah and the northern source prefers Reuben, the first-born, in the leadership role:

In brief, Joseph was hated by his brothers, who

one day sold him and/or put him into a well and faked his death. Joseph ends up in Egypt and works his way up from slave to valued advisor to the Prime Minister for the Pharaoh. His brothers come to Egypt during a famine and are brought before him.  The do not recognize him. He accuses them of being spies and demands that they bring his father and youngest brother back. When they return, he reveals his identity and is reunified with his family. They stay in Egypt.  The  father  Jacob

(Israel)  dies,  is

embalmed and buried in Canaan. Joseph dies, is embalmed and buried in Egypt. The family stays in Egypt until the Exodus.

There are numerous inconsistencies in the story, which are outlined below, along with a rebuttal to

the claim of inconsistency according to the mediaeval Jewish scholar Rashi.

in “J” (Genesis)

in “E” (Genesis)

Who saves Joseph?

Judah (37:26)

Reuben (37:21)

Joseph is

sold to Ishmaelites (37:25,27)  found by Midianites (37:28)

brought to Egypt by

Ishmaelites (37:28)

Midianites (37:36)

brothers’ bags opened

at the inn (42:9)

at home (42:35)

surety for Benjamin

Judah (43:3)

Reuben (42:37)

Rebuttal: Reuben advised not shedding Joseph’s blood but rather to throw him into the pit with the idea perhaps of rescuing Joseph later. After Joseph was thrown into the pit, Judah suggested that Joseph could be saved by selling him to the caravan of traders. Ishmaelites vs Midianites: Rashi says this indicates that Joseph was sold several times. First sold to the Ishmaelites who sold him to Midianites who then sold him to the Egyptians. Bag opened in camp vs at home: One of the brothers opens his bag at the inn and discovers the money (It is inferred that this is Levi). Later back home the other brothers also find money in their own bags. Why didn’t all the brothers open their sacks? Double sided sacks, money at the bottom of all sacks except that of Levi, who was most guilty for sale of Joseph. Evidently Joseph wanted only one tranche of money to be discovered which would not have brought them back to Egypt immediately professing innocence. Rather he wanted them to discover the money only after they reached home.

 <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canaan">Canaan</A> in the Late Bronze Age

was a shadow of what it had been centuries earlier: many cities had been abandoned, others had shrunk in size, and the total settled population was probably not much more than a hundred thousand. Settlement was concentrated in cities along the coastal plain and along major trade routes. The central and northern hill country which would later become the biblical kingdom of Israel was only sparsely inhabited, and <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</A> was a Canaanite city-state recognizing Egyptian suzerainty. Politically and culturally, Egypt was dominant; each Canaanite city had its own ruler, but was often at odds with its neighbors, appealing to Egypt to adjudicate differences. The city-state system broke down during the <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Bronze_Age_collapse">Late Bronze Age,</A> and Canaanite culture was then gradually absorbed into that of the <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philistines">Philistines, Phoenicians</A> and Israelites. The process was gradual and a strong <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt">Egyptian</A>  presence continued into the 12th century BCE.

Archeological Periods in Canaan Stone Age: c. 8500-4300 BC Copper Age: 4300-3300 BC Bronze Age: 3300-1200 BC

Early Bronze Age = 3300-2300 BC Middle Bronze Age = 2300-1550 BC Late Bronze Age = 1550-1200 BC

Iron Age: 1200-586 BC Babylonian Period: 586-539 BC Persian Period: 539-332 BC Hellenistic Period: 332-63 BC Roman Period: 63 BC-324 AD

Deconstructing the Walls of Jericho - Ze'ev Herzog

This is what archaeologists have learned from their excavations in the Land of Israel: the Israelites

were never in Egypt, did not wander in the desert, did not conquer the land in a military campaign and did not pass it on to the 12 tribes of Israel. Perhaps even harder to swallow is the fact that the united monarchy of David and Solomon, which is described by the Bible as a regional power, was at most a small tribal kingdom. And it will come as an unpleasant shock to many that the God of Israel, Jehovah, had a female consort (Asherah) and that the early Israelite religion adopted monotheism only in the waning period of the monarchy and not at Mount Sinai. Most of those who are engaged in scientific work in the interlocking spheres of the Bible, archaeology and the history of the Jewish people - and who once went into the field looking for proof to corroborate the Bible story - now agree that the historic events relating to the stages of the Jewish people's emergence are radically different from what that story tells.

Myth of the Exodus

Even this foundational myth of the Jewish religion is riven with invention and inconsistencies: First of all, there is no evidence of any type that the Israelites were ever slaves in Egypt in the first

place. They may have been: a) members of a the Canaanite immigration in advance of the Hyksos invasion of Egypt  (around 1650 BC); b) even Hyksos themselves, since the Hyksos are suspected to have been of Hurrian origin (Abraham’s birthplace). Indeed Josephus identifies the Exodus with Manetho’s report of the emigration of 480,000 Hyksos “shepherd kings” from Egypt to Jerusalem (c 1550 BC). Apion even alleges that the heretic priest Osarseph changed his name to Moses and led a rebellion against Egypt. As archaeologist Jacquetta Hawkes states, “…they were wandering groups of Semites who had long come to Egypt for trade and other peaceful purposes;” or c) perhaps they were opportunistic members (habiru) of the coalition of the Sea Peoples (1200-900 BC), who devastated the Mycenean world until stopped  (and enslaved?) by Egypt.

Second, there is no record of any sort outside of

biblical scripture that describes the ten plagues visited upon Egypt. This seems to be pure invention by Exilic scribes in Babylon.

Third, the passage of 603,550 armed men

(Numbers 1:46) with wives, children and “a mixed multitude of non-Israelites” would have formed a parade of nearly 2 million, who if marching ten-abreast would form a column 150 miles long through the Sinai desert. Their place of habitation for 38 years after refusing to challenge the Canaanites, Kadesh Barnea, would have been the largest city in the Middle East, yet shows no signs at all of any habitation prior to 1000 BC.

Egyptian Empire 1500-1200 BCE

Fourth, the culture of the earliest Israelite settlements is Canaanite, their cult objects are those of the

Canaanite god El (before the adoption of the war god YHWH), the pottery remains are in the Canaanite tradition, and the alphabet used is early Canaanite. Almost the sole marker distinguishing the "Israelite" villages from Canaanite sites is an absence of pig bones.

Fifth, Kings 6:1 maintains that the Exodus occurred 480 years before the construction of Solomon’s

Temple: that would be 1450 BC. At that time, not only was Egypt not afraid of a foreign enemy (Pharaoh’s ostensible motive for suppressing the Israelites), but the Israelites would have been escaping from Egypt to … Egypt! Canaan was part of the Egyptian empire (see map) until 1200 BC.

Finally, the widespread use of dromedaries (Exodus 9:3) was not known in Egypt until late in the

first millennium BC. Also, at the time of the “invasion” of Canaan by the Israelites, Jericho was not a walled city at all, but was “small, poor, almost insignificant, and unfortified.”

Joshua's “conquest” of Canaan

The returning Israelites are instructed by their “god” not to buy land as had Abraham, but rather to invade and obliterate any remnant of the local culture. Deut 7:2 “And when the Lord thy God shall deliver them before thee; thou shalt smite them, and utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto them:”

Perhaps the most unsettling part of the Exodus myth is that the Post-Exilic priests wrote the legends of early Israelite history in such a savage and chauvinistic tone. One case may serve as an exemplar: Num 31:1 “And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Numbers-31-2/">2</A> Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites: afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people<A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Numbers-31-3/">.3</A> And Moses spake unto the people, saying, Arm some of yourselves unto the war, and let them go against the Midianites, and avenge the LORD of Midian…. <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Numbers-31-7/">7</A> And they warred against the Midianites, as the LORD commanded Moses; and they slew all the males… <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Numbers-31-9/">9</A> And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives, and their little ones, and took the spoil of all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods. <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Numbers-31-10/">10</A> And they burnt all their cities  wherein they dwelt, and all their goodly castles, with fire. <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Numbers-31-11/">11</A> And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of men and of beasts…

 <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Numbers-31-14/">14</A> And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, with the captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which came from the battle.  <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Numbers-31-15/">15</A> And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive? <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Numbers-31-16/">16</A> Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the

“Thy will be done.”

LORD.

 <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Numbers-31-17/">17</A> Now therefore kill every male among the little ones , and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Numbers-31-18/">18</A> But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves  …<A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Numbers-31-35/">35</A> And thirty and two thousand persons in all, of women that had not known man by lying with him… 47Even of the children of Israel's half, Moses took one portion of fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them unto the Levites, which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses… 51And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even all wrought jewels  …53 For the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.”

Later, in America, the Puritans would see themselves as latter-day Israelites coming into a new Canaan, where “God” (smallpox) had cleared the land before them. They thereupon acted as Joshua had and took over the settlements, killing men, women, and children without mercy. Small wonder ‘patriotic American Christians’ were not upset with the killing of babies at My Lai.

Human/Child Sacrifice

It seems the gods of Canaan and likewise YHWH had a taste for blood. Reference to sacrifices: By neighboring peoples to their gods: Burnt offerings of children are documented to Moloch (Deut

12:31, 2Kings 23:10), the sacrifice of the first-born by Moab (2Kings 3:27)

By Israelites to YHWH: Josiah  burns human bones to YHWH (1Kings 13:1-2, 2Chron 34:1-5),

David sacrifices two of Saul’s sons and five of his grandsons to YHWH (2Sam 21:1, 8-14), a town and people are made a burnt offering to YHWH (Deut 13:13-19), YHWH kills all the first-born of Egypt (Ex 13:11-16), YHWH claims all the first-born of Israel as his (Ex 13:2), YHWH hands men over to be ‘fuel for the fire’ (Ez 21:33-37), YHWH demands Isaac be sacrificed (Gen 22:2), a city-full of people is offered as a sacrifice to YHWH (Josh 6:21), a thief is burned to death (Josh 7:15), Jephthah sacrifices his daughter as a burnt offering to YHWH (Judges 11:29-40), every devoted thing - both of man and beast - shall be put to death (Lev 27:28), Moses orders the murder of Midianite women and children (Num 31:25-40), YHWH gives statutes that the first-born are to ‘pass through the fire’ (Ez 20:25-26)

By Israelites to other gods: Ahaz burns his son as an offering (2Kings 16:2-3), Manassah rebuilds

altars to Baal and worships foreign gods, as had Ahab (2Kings 21:1-6), Israelites sacrifice their children to Moloch (Ez 16:20-21, 23:37, Is 57:5, Jer 7:31, 19:5, 32:35, Lev 20:2, Ps 106:37-41)

Also note that in all of these legends, the only important character is the male lead; the usually nameless wives and children are mere ciphers: Job’s original family, Lot’s wife, Lot’s daughter, Jephtha’s daughter, King Mesha’s son, Ahaz’s son, Isaac, the Innocents. Human sacrifice is disguised as a necessity, blood sacrifice is preferred (hence god’s preference for the offering of Abel), and of course, Jesus, whose sacrifice is memorialized by

a daily cannibalistic ritual. ‘Without the shedding of blood, there is no remission’ (Heb 9:13-22).

Indeed, the deaths of Job’s family are mere collateral damage of a wager between YHWH and Satan:

Job 1:12 <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Job-1-12/">And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Job-1-12/">himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD. 13 And</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Job-1-13/">there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Job-1-13/">brother's house: 14 And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Job-1-14/">the asses feeding beside them: 15 And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Job-1-15/">have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. 16</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Job-1-16/">While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Job-1-16/">heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Job-1-16/">escaped alone to tell thee. 17 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Job-1-17/">Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Job-1-17/">slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. 18 While he</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Job-1-18/">was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Job-1-18/">drinking wine in their eldest brother's house: 19 And, behold, there came a great wind from the</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Job-1-19/">wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Job-1-19/">dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</A>

El, Baal, Asherah, and YHWH (Jehovah)

The earliest ancestor’s of Israel worshipped a god named El (Gen 16:13, 17:1, 21:33, 31:13, 35:7, 11, 43:14, 58:3), El-Elohe-Israel (Gen 33:20), as well as the peace-loving god of vegetation in the Syro-Palestinian pantheon, Baal, and Asherah. The prevalence of their worship is evidenced by the numerous times such altars must be removed. Their altars existed alongside those of YHWH as evidenced by Gideon’s father, Joash, who had altars to Baal and Asherah (Judges 6:25). The fact that Gideon had to destroy his father’s “pagan” altars at night, and was almost executed for his act, further indicates the widespread  acceptance of Baal and Asherah.

YHWH was once viewed as a member of a pantheon ruled over by El. Deut 32:8-9 When the most High (El) divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel. 9. For the LORD’s (YHWH’s) portion is his people: Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.

YHWH seems to have achieved supremacy as Israel’s national god due his military prowess

Asherah

(“YHWH of the Armies”), while in times of peace, Baal would ensure fertility. YHWH, the <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_god">national god</A> of war for both Israel and Judah, seems to have originated in <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edom">Edom</A> and  <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midian">Midian</A> in southern Canaan and may have been brought to Israel by the <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenites">Kenites</A> and <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midianites">Midianites.</A>  Worship of YHWH can be traced back to the time of Moses (Ex 6:3) and seems to be associated with the south of Palestine, for Moses first encounters him in Midian (Ex 18). Further Jael, a Kenite (southern) heroine in YHWH’s wars, is cited in Judg 5:24-30, and Deut 33:2 And he said, The LORD (YHWH) came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir

Baal

unto them.

With the emergence of the monarchy, the kings promoted their family god, <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahweh">Y</A>HWH, as the <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henotheism">god of</A>   <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henotheism">the kingdom,</A> but beyond the royal court, religion continued to be polytheistic. The major deities were not numerous - <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_%28god%29">El, Asherah</A> (spouse of El?), YHWH, and <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baal">Baal.</A> At an early stage El and YHWH became fused and Asherah worship ceased as a separate state cult, although she continued to be popular at the local level until Persian times.

The Dubious Priestly Myth of David and Solomon

On editorial license and the legend of David: David raises the heretofore undistinguished Canaanite city of Jerusalem and the Judean Samuelite (Southern) priesthood to their positions of religious dominance, at the expense of Shiloh and the Elide (Northern) priesthood. Solomon cultivates the priests, installing the line of Zadok as High Priests, and so Solomon’s sudden unlineal accession is justified at the expense of the legitimate heir, Adonijah.

The Judean Zadokite priesthood (J) later edit and write the two main works of Israelite history: Genesis to Second Kings (G2K) and Chronicles (Chron), in which David is absolved of any knowledge of or guilt in the deaths of his many enemies: Saul, Abner, Ishbosheth, and Absolom. Indeed, while G2K invents alibis for all David’s numerous improprieties in his rise to power and reign:

that David was serving the Philistine king Achish when Achish’s forces killed Saul;

and the irregularities of David’s reign:

his alliance with Nahash, king of Ammon, enemy of Israel; extermination of Saul’s rightful successor, Ishbosheth, and the rest of Saul’s line; Bathsheba; Absalom; Sheba; Adonijah; and Solomon’s secret, sudden accession.

Chronicles simply ignores them. Chronicles overlaps with parts of G2K, but is a more theologized (pro-Judean) version - stressing the role of Levites, virtually ignoring affairs of the north (Israel), exaggerating numbers, replete with miraculous events, and giving a highly idealized version of David. Legends unique to Chronicles must be approached with caution, and are best viewed as a compendium of purposeful inventions from pro-Davidic Judean sources.

The Line of Saul

a Benjamite representative of northern, Israelite interests, challenges the Philistines in the hill country, rules Ephraim, and is supported by Elide priests of Shiloh, leading to conflict with Samuel. Saul is crowned king, offers sacrifice when Samuel is late and for that is blamed by Samuel. David comes to Saul’s court as a soldier, plays his flute for Saul, now portrayed as a solitary paranoiac, and becomes his armor-bearer. David volunteers to Saul to kill Goliath and tries on Saul’s armor. David kills the 9-foot tall Goliath. Samuel orders Saul to “kill all the Amelekites,” but Saul takes Amelikite king Agog prisoner, whom Samuel kills. Samuel condemns Saul a second time for not killing Agog, and claims God has removed his blessing from Saul, so Samuel anoints David, and “the spirit of YHWH” (saving grace) is transferred from Saul to David. Saul’s son Jonathan loves David, and gives him his clothes (sign of abdication to David?). David’s fame as a military hero exceeds that of Saul (1Sam18), so Saul is jealous of David. Saul’s daughter Michal marries David; David flees to Samuel; Saul’s messengers sent to find David all begin prophesying; David flees to Achish, the Philistine king of Gath, where he gathers a rebel army in the service of Achish, whose forces kill Saul and Jonathan at Mount Gilboa, a battle from which David is suspiciously written out. The people of Judah come to Hebron and anoint David, who rules Judah from Hebron for seven years. He carries on good relations with the Philistines, and allies with Nahash, king of Ammon, enemy of Israel (1Sam11, 2Sam10, 17). A long war then ensues between David and the house of Saul (2Sam2)

1000 Ishbosheth is Saul’s rightful heir (and, unfortunately for him, a Northerner). Abner, Saul’s cousin, is the real power behind Ishbosheth. David is at this time allied with the Philistines. Abner accesses Saul’s harem as the first step to taking power, is chastised, begins negotiations with David, comes to David at Hebron, seals the agreement betraying Ishbosheth, and is then and there assassinated by David’s military commander, Joab (David is aghast!) ; then Ishbosheth is assassinated (David is unconsolable!).

1Chronicles - All About Dave

From Adam to Israel - a genealogical list, arranged with Israel last and pointing to its election by God. The Tribes of Israel - Emphasis on Judah, Benjamin, and Levi: the “loyal” tribes in the schism. Jabez's Prayer preaches the  “Health-Wealth Gospel,” ignoring care for others and faithful service. Restored Jerusalem Community  - the crucial link between Chron's community and their past. Saul as an example of unfaithfulness: Chron is only interested in the death of Saul, who is a foil for David and Solomon, as alterations in the source material make clear.

David as King of All Israel: the lurid aspects in Samuel are largely ignored: the war between Saul and David, his adultery with Bathsheba, his murder of Uriah, the questionable circumstances of Solomon's birth, and the struggle for power between David's sons .

David First Brings the Ark to Jerusalem to establish proper worship, at odds with 2Sam5-6, where David first defeats the Philistines and then rebuilds Jerusalem. After Uzzah's death for touching the ark, David orders that only Levites carry the ark, ascribing a liturgical practice from Chron’s own day to David’s.

God’s Promises that David’s line will always be on the throne of Judah and that of forgiveness to Solomon form the two pillars of the theology of the returning exiles.

David notices Bathsheba

David’s Wars are successful when he trusts God. The Ammonite War is omitted, possibly because of David's adultery with Bathsheba, his murder of her husband, and implied illegitimacy of their progeny, Solomon.

David’s Census at the urging of “Satan” (1Chron 21:1) displeases God and results in severe plagues. So who is "Satan" and why does he incite David? The Hebrew word satan means adversary. In Job and Zechariah, it implies a divine being, though not yet the dualistic personification of Evil of later Judaism and the New Testament, a concept that emerges during the Persian era. It seems best to interpret David's Satan as "a human adversary," perhaps a military threat. But then 2Sam24:1 states, “Again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he incited David against them, saying, 'Go, count the people of Israel and Judah'" Is God’s anger Satan? And what's so wrong with counting the people, anyway? Is it because apportioning Israel for taxation and conscription was a drastic change from long-held beliefs in Israel's tradition, or did David's numbering of the people arise from prideful assumptions about military might that led him away from trust in God?

David has "shed much blood." And so  commissions Solomon as the divinely chosen temple builder. David authorizes a Temple bureaucracy that only existed in the postexilic period. David Transfers the Kingdom and Charges Solomon (totally at odds with 1K1-2). There is no controversy over who will be king, no mention of Nathan, Bathsheba, or Adonijah. Solomon has no one killed and does not engage in the palace intrigues that occupy the initial chapters of 1 Kings. The repeated notice is only that God has chosen Solomon to rule Israel and build the temple.

King David

1000 BCE With the murder of Ishbosheth, the path is finally clear for David and his Judean priest Zadok to take over. The elders of Israel come to David and anoint him. David conquers Jerusalem, up to that time a very modest settlement whose name means “founded by Shalem (a Canaanite god)”, and brings the ark of the covenant to Jerusalem (to the resentment of the ten Northern tribes). Nathan pronounces YHWH’s blessing on David’s kingship and promises his dynasty will last forever (2Sam7). David executes Saul’s descendants (2Sam21) and empowers the High Priest Zadok and Levites from Bethlehem, loyal to David, who are scattered throughout the kingdom, a priesthood, not unlike the Jesuits, fiercely loyal to their king. David fights frontier wars with the Philistines, Moabites, Edomites, Ammonites, and Aramaeans. "Zion theology," the idea that the god of Israel has chosen Jerusalem for his dwelling-place and that the <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davidic_dynasty">Davidic dynasty</A> will reign there forever, becomes the state ideology. The House of David rules Jerusalem for four hundred years to 586 BCE. G2K makes an obvious effort to present David in a favorable light, as YHWH’s Chosen One. “House of David” appears in the Tell Dan inscription. David as the Psalmist? - ledawid, the term based on which the Psalms are attribute to David, likely means not “by David,” but rather dedicated “to David.” David is portrayed chiefly as a musician in Chronicles, though G2K has little on this aspect. The later the version of the story, the more psalms are ascribed to David.

Absolom, Adonijah, and Solomon

0970 BCE The most senior and noble of David’s remaining sons (son of an Aramaean princess from Geshur 2Sam3:3, the only one of David’s sons of royal blood, since Amnon had been killed by him for raping their sister Tamar), Absolom enjoys popular support, rises against David, and David flees Jerusalem, but not before installing his ally Hushai as a disinformant “adviser” to Absalom. Absalom takes over David’s harem (now there’s no turning back). David deploys Ittai and 600 Philistine mercenaries (2Sam15). Hushai discredits Achitophel; Absalom is defeated at Gilead, and is killed by Joab, whom David executes for not dealing “gently” with Absalom. David is restored, then executes all of Saul’s male descendants. The next in line of David’s sons, Adonijah, proclaims himself king (1Kings 1:5-8). Nathan reports Adonijah’s actions to Bathsheba, who convinces the senile David to authorize the crowning of her son, Solomon, in a surprise ceremony orchestrated by Nathan, Zadok and Benaiah (1Kings 1:38-40).

0967-0928 BCE Solomon - Legends are written into Scripture of the Queen of Sheba and Solomon’s reign as a “golden age,” stretching from the Euphrates (?!) to the Egyptian frontier. Solomon is reputed to be wealthy, powerful, and wise.

But is he “wealthy”? Cash flow problems force him to sell twenty cities in Galilee to the Phoenician king of Tyre (1Kings 9:10), and there are no trade items in Solomonic ruins.

Is he “powerful”? He is constantly troubled by Hadad of Edom, Rezin of Damascus, and Jeroboam of Ephraim (1Kings 11:10), his adversaries sent by YHWH “because his wives had turned Solomon’s heart to other gods”

Uxorious Solomon worships a foreign god

(priestly self-justification).

Is he “wise”? He used forced labor and other despotic practices that caused the kingdom to break into two immediately after his death (1Kings 12:1). Furthermore, he is not mentioned in any non- Judean sources. Religiously, Solomon had broken the mandate of the <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah">Torah</A> by marrying foreign wives, and worshipping and building shrines to the <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moab">Moabite</A> and <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammon">Ammonite</A> gods (1Kings 11:1-13).

Why then is he so represented? Again, it is because he is credited with building the Temple and establishing the Zadokite sacerdotal ascendancy, so he is a hero to the priests, who later edited and wrote the Scriptures. He succeeds David as king, and forms diplomatic alliances through marriage. He builds the First Temple on Mt. Moriah, which becomes the only acceptable location for sacrifice, thereby granting a religious monopoly to the Zadokites. Chronicles ignores the issue of Solomon’s accession by having David designate him as his successor, and omits all unseemly circumstances, such as the attacks by Hiram of Tyre, Hadad, Rezin, Jeroboam, forced labor, and Ahijah’s prediction that Jeroboam would rule.

~~~~~~~~

Solomon’s successor? The Zadokite Priesthood!

0928 BCE Solomon dies, and simmering conflicts split the country between the northern Ten Tribes: Reuben, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, Asher, Issachar, Zebulun, Joseph (split into Ephraim, Manasseh, and Machir [Manasseh east of the Jordan] ) and the four southern tribes: Judah, Levi (divested of land), Simeon (surrounded and assimilated by Judah), and Benjamin (conquered by Judah in 955). The most divisive issue between Israel (the northern ten) and Judah (the southern four) is the requirement that sacrifice to YHWH be performed exclusively by Zadokite priests at the Temple in Jerusalem. This policy effectively delists Shiloh, the location of the Tent of Meeting (Joshua 18:1), where the Ark of the Covenant had been kept, defrocks its Aaronite priesthood, and constitutes a declaration of religious war.

The Hebrew Scriptures will be written by southern Judean scribes, who demand exclusive Yahwism (no gods but YHWH), and condemn Israel. Jeroboam, the Ephraimite head of Solomon’s forced labor operations, is proclaimed by Ahijah of Shiloh as YHWH’s “next man” (1Kings 11:29), who will become king of the northern tribes; he flees to Egypt until Solomon’s death.

At Solomon’s death, the Assembly at Shechem is convened to crown Rehoboam. Leaders of the ten northern tribes ask Rehoboam if he intends to be as repressive as Solomon; Rehoboam responds that he will be worse: “My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke: my father also chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions." (1Kings 12:14).

The split is justified by the Judean editors of Scripture as punishment for Solomon’s failure to follow priestly exhortations; namely by marrying foreign wives and worshipping foreign gods. (1Kings 11:9-12): “9. And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned from the Lord God of Israel ... 10 And had commanded him

That he should not go after other gods…11.Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom away from thee and will give it to thy servant. 12 Notwithstanding in thy days, I will not do it for David thy father’s sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son."

From Davidic to Divided Kingdom

Ruler in Judah (South)

Ruler in Israel (North)

0927 Jeroboam (927-906) fortifies Shechem, rejects the Royal Zion Theology of the Davidic line designated by prophets, rejects the Jerusalem priesthood by appointing Aaronite non-Zadokite priests, institutes a new cultic calendar, and has annual celebrations at Bethel  (he too ignores the Elide sanctuary at Shiloh), not Jerusalem. Israel in the north, desirous of retaining its traditions, locates its capital at Samaria.  Having a broadly diverse population on the main Syro- Palestinian trade route and thus subject to outside influences, Jeroboam allows worship of Baal, largely to accommodate outsiders; he also builds sanctuaries at Bethel and Dan with golden calves made to the specifications of Aaron’s golden calf to mark the borders. Israelite political life is, however, very unstable: seven kings are assassinated, each time with a regime change; only the lines of Omri and Jehu are able to hold kingship more than two generations.

0926 Rehoboam - In Judah, Rehoboam (926-910), whose mother, Naamah of Ammon, was one of Solomon’s foreign wives, enjoys a 17-year reign. He retains Jerusalem as Judah's capital but in the fifth year of his reign (922), Egyptian pharaoh Shishaq captures all of the fortified towns leading to Jerusalem between Gezer and Gibeon. When he lays siege to Jerusalem, Rehoboam gives Shishaq all the treasures out of the temple as a tribute. The Egyptian campaign cuts off trade with south Arabia via Elath and the Negev established during Solomon's reign, and Judah becomes a vassal state of Egypt. Of course, the priests attribute Shishaq’s invasion to “divine punishment” for Rehoboam’s apostasy (disobedience to the priests).  “Judah did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they committed, more than all that their fathers had done. For they also built for themselves high places (altars to Baal), and pillars, and Asherim on every high hill and under every green tree; and there were also male cult prostitutes in the land. They did according to all the abominations of the nations which the Lord drove out before the people of Israel.” (1Kings 14:22-24) Chron’s agenda here becomes plain: sin brings judgment, obedience brings blessing, and repentance brings deliverance. References in Chron to the north (Israel) are omitted whenever possible. Kings obedient to the priesthood prosper in terms of military victory and wealth through tribute, building projects, rest, and progeny. Disobedient kings experience punishment in the form of military defeat, physical deformity, illness, or untimely death.

0915 Abijah - Chron approves of the obedient Abijah  (though he is condemned in 1K 15:3), whose speech is a list of Chron's themes: David's throne, Solomon's temple, all Israel, and reliance upon God.

0913 Asa - Chron explains Asa’s foreign alliance with Ben-Hadad of Damascus and his diseased feet by dividing Asa into two periods: one of faithfulness and a second of apostasy.

0879 Omri - (879-869) Israel reaches its zenith: when

Israelite king Elah is assassinated by Zimri, Omri’s troops proclaim Omri king (nothing is said of his tribe), and he builds a new capital at Samaria, he marries Jezebel, princess of Sidon, to his son, Ahab. Judah becomes a vassal to the Omrides (1Kgs 22:4). Epigraphical evidence of the Omride Dynasty includes the Mesha Inscription (the Moabite Stone, which relates how the Moabite god Chemosh, angry with his people, delivers them into the hands of Israel,

20







then assists Mesha to liberate Moab). Jehoram of Israel then marshals Judah to reimpose Israelite control (2K3:4- 28); the Tel Dan Stele, which details how Israelite king Jehoram was killed (probably by Hazael, the Aramaean king of Syria); and the Siloam Inscription, which commemorates the completion of a tunnel from Gihon Spring to Siloam Pool. Judah is not documented as a separate state until 733, when Ahaz severs his loyalty to Samaria. Omri subjugates Moab, joins the anti-Assyrian coalition with Syria, reaches the Mediterranean, and allies with Tyre.

0873 Jehoshaphat (870-849) undertakes a maritime venture with Israel because access had been gained to the Gulf of Aqabah. His portrayal in Kings as the nadir of Judean fortunes is starkly different from that in Chron, to whom he is so dear for removing the idols that Chron reads back into Jehoshaphat’s legend the post-exilic separation of civil and sacred law. Chapter 20’s battle account is another roll call of Chron’s themes: Zadokite leadership, retributive justice, reliance upon God, condemnation of foreign alliances, God's rule, and answered prayer.

0868 Ahab (868-850) associates with Phoenicians, marries Jezebel, builds a temple to Baal, and, worst of all, expropriates farmers - becoming thereby very unpopular. The Omride dynasty gains a reputation for economic and social injustice (Naboth Vineyard). The cities - Shechem and Samaria are prosperous and inclusive (Liberal), but the countryside is poor and Yahwist (Fundamentalist). Yahwist prophets’ condemnation of the apostasy of Israel and Jezebel is clearly the work of later pro-Judean compilers who, oversimplifying and exaggerating, project exclusive Yahwism and the primacy of Jerusalem back into earlier times.  Foreign wives are the supposed source of palace apostasy. The Samarian temple to Baal provides foreign traders and diplomats a place to worship, but is a source of competition with exclusive Yahwism, and so must be shunned.  Elijah incites the crowd to murder

The Seductress Jezebel (or Cleopatra?)

the prophets of Baal (1Kgs 18:40). Ahab is a co-leader

of the anti-Assyrian coalition. The names of Judah and Edom are absent from the list of supporters (perhaps they were subsumed under Israel at the time). There are no archeological remains from the (supposedly grand) Solomonic Jerusalem to equal Ahab’s temple to Baal, or the fortifications of Megiddo, Jezreel, or Hazor.

~0850 Prophetic narratives in conflict: In the Elijah stories: (Widow of Zarephath, The Challenge to Baal, Mount Horeb, The Vineyard of Naboth, Ahaziah, Ascension into Heaven, Elijah as a harbinger of the Messiah in Malachi), Israel is supreme, Baal worship is widespread, Jezebel is the chief villain, and there is conflict with Yahwist prophets. In the Elisha stories (Adoption by Elijah, Elijah’s Ascension, Defeating the Moabites, Killing the Mocking Children, Multiplying the Widow’s Oil, Resurrection of the Child of Shunem, Healing of the Syrian Naaman, Making Iron Float), Israel is weak, Yahwism is strongly supported, Israel is on good terms with Yahwist prophets, and miraculous deeds are performed.  The Ben-Hadad stories (three battles between Syria and Israel) are expanded to give Yahwist prophets center stage, and emphasize

Elijah resurrects the son of the Widow of Zarephath

Jehoshaphat’s loyalty to YHWH.

21







0850 Ahaziah (of Israel) (850-849) Ahab is

succeeded by his son Ahaziah, who is refused participation in Jehoshaphat’s maritime venture.

0849 Jehoram (849-842)  Ahaziah (of Israel) dies childless, so Ahab’s sister Athaliah marries Jehoram, son of Jehoshaphat, the two royal families are joined, and Israel and Judah reunite! This is, however, a period of rapid decline for both kingdoms. Jehoram’s Moabite Campaign is retold to give center stage to Elisha, and again emphasize Jehoshaphat’s piety - folk themes with numerous miraculous circumstances, which are ignored in Chron, except to treat of Jehoshaphat, and blame the failure of his maritime venture on cooperation with Israel. Chron deems Jehoram's alliance with Ahab in the north as responsible for his defeat in war, plague, and early death, all which extend into the reigns of Ahaziah and Athaliah. All three are related to Ahab, adopt Ahabic Baalism, die horrible deaths, and are denied burial in the royal cemetery.

0842 Ahaziah (of Judah) is a pawn of his mother, Athaliah, daughter of Ahab and Jezebel and granddaughter of Omri. He is killed either by Jehu (G2K) or Hazael (Tel Dan Stele).

0842 Athaliah is the only non-Davidic ruler, woman, and foreigner to sit upon Judah’s throne. Wife of King Jehoram through a foreign alliance with her father King Ahab of Israel, she takes the throne upon the death of her son Ahaziah, and consolidates her power by assassinating the remaining members of the Davidic line. However, Jehoshabeath, Jehoram's daughter, rescues her infant nephew Joash and hides him in the temple for six years with her husband Jehoiada the priest, thus preserving the Davidic line.

0842 Joash, under the tutelage of Jehoiada the priest, carries out needed temple repairs, but after Jehoiada’s death, Joash lapses into apostasy (contrary to 2K12) and is assassinated in his bed by his servants, a victim of

Athaliah

Chron's idea of retributive justice.

0839 Jehu  (839-822)  The Jehu Dynasty:  According

to G2K, Jehu, urged on by the prophet Elisha, kills Jehoram and Jezebel, then hosts a “feast” for the prophets of Baal whereat he massacres them, though in the Tel Dan Stele Hazael of Syria claims to have killed Jehoram and Ahaziah (of Judah), so that both Jehu in Samaria and Athaliah in Jerusalem seem to have come to power in the political upheaval caused by Hazael.  Assyria then becomes active again and saves both Israel and Judah from further attacks by Hazael. A problem for the compilers is that YHWH is expected to give victory to those that support him, but Jehu was powerless before Hazael, and Jeroboam II overshadows his Yahwist Judean contemporary Uzziah. Furthermore, the Elisha stories from the Omride period fit the Jehu period better.  Chronicles, on the other hand, completely ignores Israel, gives Levites important roles, and praises pro-Yahwist kings. The prophets Hosea and Amos emerge. During the Jehu Century, Israel and Judah submit to Syria and Assyria (according to the Black Obelisk).

0800 Amaziah also starts off well, but sinks into apostasy (again contrary to 2 Kings 14) by rejecting the word of the prophet, and suffers military defeat and assassination. For Chron, defeat proves guilt.

0788 Jeroboam II (788-748), restores Israel’s

borders and participates in the Assyrian economic realm, but as Assyria declines, the wealthy upper class of Israel intensifies its predations on the weak.

0785 Uzziah (785-760) rules Judah under the shadow of Jeroboam II. He remains on good terms with the temple priests for the first part of his reign, but Chron ascribes to him the cultic offense of burning incense (?), punished by leprosy, banishment from the temple, and burial in a field. The prophet Amos is on the spot to point the finger of blame.

0746 Zechariah - Shallum - Menahem (746-738)

Zechariah is murdered by Shallum, a captain of his army, who takes the throne, thus ending the Jehu Dynasty. Shallum is then deposed by Menahem, an ally of Assyria, now dominant under Tiglath-Pileser.

0742 Jotham is a refreshing model of obedience and blessing. 0735 Ahaz - Chron has Judah sinking to its lowest point under Ahaz (according to G 2K, it was under Manasseh), because he worships foreign gods, and stops the sacrifices in the temple. In Chron, bad kings (Ahaz, Manasseh) alternate with good kings (Hezekiah, Josiah). Ahaz sacrifices a son (2K16:3) to Moloch to lift the Syro-Ephraimite siege of Jerusalem, as had the Moabite king Mesha on an earlier occasion. Ahaz, supervised by the priest Uriah without protest (2K16:10), constructs a Syrian altar, then is forced to abdicate because of health (in Chron because he worships Syrian gods). Isaiah encourages Ahaz to continue his pro-Assyrian policies, but he is hard-pressed by Rezin of Syria, the Edomites, Israelite King Pekah, and the Philistines to join the anti-

Ahaz Sacrificing his Son

Assyrian block (denounced by Micah). Isaiah supports defending Jerusalem, and letting YHWH handle the rest. In 0 734, the Assyrians return to the relief of Judea, and suppress Rezin. Ahaz, now independent of Israel, pays tribute to Tiglath-Pileser.0734 Pekah  (734-31) kills Pekakiah, and with support from Rezin, takes over part of Israel, now called Ephraim. To get Judah to join their anti-Assyrian coalition, they then attack Jerusalem, as recorded in Isaiah 7-8. Pekah is killed, and Hoshea becomes an Assyrian vassal. 0732 Hoshea (732-722) Egypt’s 25th</span><span class="cls_003"> Dynasty becomes a</span></div competitor with Assyria for dominance in the Middle East. Israelite King Hoshea buys in to the Egyptian propaganda and ceases tribute payments to Assyria. When Assyria attacks Israel, the Egyptians do not come to his aid, and Israel falls. G2K predictably blames Israel’s apostasy and failure to heed prophets for its fall. Many people are deported from Israel to Assyria and replaced with settlers from other parts of the Assyrian empire - such population exchanges were an established part of Assyrian imperial policy, a means of breaking the old power structure. The captives in Assyria are split up, quickly assimilate, and thus ten of the twelve tribes disappear.  Judah remains loyal to

Fall of Samaria

Assyria (for the moment) and survives as an Assyrian vassal.

0727 Hezekiah (727-699) Judah recovers with much biblical glorification in G2K and Isaiah. Samaria is taken by the Assyrians, and Isaiah advises Hezekiah, king of Judah in the South, to capitulate. The Assyrians surround Jerusalem, but are mysteriously killed (plague?), and Jerusalem is saved for now. Hezekiah shows the state treasures to Merodach-baladan of Babylon, and Isaiah predicts he (Hezekiah) will be carried into Babylon.  In Chron, Levites purify the temple, reinstate proper worship, and destroy local shrines; the people bring tithes, and Hezekiah and Isaiah pray together. Hezekiah grows ill because of his pride, but humbles himself, and gets better; Jerusalem is spared. Back in the real world, Sargon dies, and revolt in Assyrian lands spreads. Isaiah: I told you that Assyria was a temporary power; Hezekiah revolts; Sennacherib invades and devastates the countryside, but can’t

23







take Jerusalem (partly due to the Siloam water tunnel). When Israel falls to Assyria (0722), Hezekiah invites the Northerners to a renewed celebration of the Passover, and, according to Chron, defends Jerusalem against Sennacherib's invading army through prayer. Overlooked by Chron are Hezekiah's surrender to Sennacherib, his trust in foreign alliances, the stripping of the temple, and Isaiah's rebuke. Judah becomes an Assyrian client state controlling the valuable olive industry.

0700 Universal dominion of YHWH  is asserted by Tobit, a Naphthalian captive in 722, who preaches that the diaspora is good since it spreads worship of YHWH, and Isaiah who maintains YHWH has empowered the Assyrians and Babylonians in order to punish Israel. Isaiah also attacks corrupt officials who oppress the poor.

0698 Manasseh (698-644) is Judah's worst king, according to G2Kings: worse than Ahaz since he allowed non- Yahwist altars (as a quid pro quo for access to Assyria’s export markets?), though his reign of 55 years is the longest in Israel or Judah. He inherits a war-torn country, yet with Assyrian power now at its acme, Judah prospers.

0642 Amon  undoes all the reforms of his repentant father, Manasseh. He is assassinated. 0641 Josiah (641-610) (8 years old) is put on the throne by Judean aristocrats.  High priest Hilkiah “discovers” the Book of Deuteronomy, which contains a frightening assessment of the fate due to Judah for her sins of tolerating other faiths. Josiah then murders all agents of alien faiths (and sodomites) and destroys their sanctuaries in a rampage that puts Kristallnacht to shame. He reinstitutes Passover and then dies in an encounter with Pharoah Neco. In Kings no mention is made of a message from YHWH communicated by Neko (an odd choice for a messenger). The fact that in spite of his pious actions, YHWH will still punish Judah for the sins of Manasseh indicates that the legend was written after the fall of Judah. Further, the many forms of non-Yahwist idolatry which he suppresses are testimony to the continuous, widespread acceptance of Baal, Asherah and others in Judah in the 300 years since

Josiah Hearing the Book of the Law

Solomon. Chron’s account of Josiah has the precocious child tearing down altars at twelve years of age, even before Deuteronomy is found. Pharaoh Neco arrives, having been sent by YHWH (?!), and warns Josiah to stay out of his way. Neko fails to do so and is killed. Jeremiah makes a cameo appearance lamenting his death.0630 Assyrian power collapses; now the competition is between Egypt and Babylonia

aggression, kill Josiah, depose his son Jehoahaz, and

24







install Jehoiakim (608-598) as a puppet king. In 605, Nebuchadnezzar defeats Egypt at Carchemish and solidifies Babylon's supremacy. Jeremiah, supported by high-ranking family and officials, endorses submission to Babylon and gives his famous temple sermon that the Jerusalem temple, like that of Shiloh, is to be destroyed. Jeremiah is thereafter barred from entering the temple.

0598 An anti-Babylonian meeting, opposed by Jeremiah but supported by the people, is held in Jerusalem including Judah, Moab, Ammon, Tyre, and Sidon. Jehoiakim decides to withhold tribute from Babylon, and to ally with a more assertive Egypt, though Pharoah Neco is only interested in access to the sea and will abandon Judah. Nebuchadrezzar captures Jerusalem (the first time), as Jehoiakim dies waiting for Egyptian help.

0598 Jehoiachin - Zedekiah - Jehoiakim’s son Jehoiachin is captured and led to Babylon with Ezekiel and leading citizens in the first Babylonian captivity. Zedekiah is placed on the throne by the Babylonians.

0587 Nebuchadrezzar has not been around for awhile, and Egypt defeats Nubia, so Zedekiah rebels. Jerusalem is besieged, and when Jeremiah predicts YHWH will fight for Babylon, he is put in the stocks. This time, Egypt sends an army that briefly lifts the siege, but finally loses interest and the siege is reimposed. Zedekiah is taken before Nebuchadrezzar: his sons are killed before him, he is then blinded and taken to Babylon. Jerusalem is conquered (the second time) by Babylon, the Temple is destroyed, and leading families are forcibly moved to Babylon (Second Babylonian Captivity). The destruction of Jerusalem, its Temple, and the Davidic dynasty by Babylon is deeply traumatic. Prophets and Deuteronomist priests will claim vindication of prophecies (to be written later in Babylon), and blame the fall of the state on apostasy rather than YHWH’s weakness. G2K is written to explain to a Judah in Babylon why they were exiled; Chron is written to the returned community,

would last seventy years, a mere interlude  to allow the land to enjoy its neglected Sabbaths.

Babylonian Rule

The reign of Gedaliah, a non-Davidic ruler appointed by Nebuchadrezzar, is suppressed by the biblical compilers. Ishmael, a Davidic claimant, assassinates Gedaliah, but is opposed by Judean officials, and so flees to Egypt, taking Jeremiah. The third Babylonian deportation then ensues. G2K and Chron are silent as to Judah after the fall, but Jeremiah, Ezekiel and Deutero-Isaiah 40-55 document the state of affairs. Aramaic becomes the dominant spoken language. Deutero-Isaiah asserts the first truly Hebrew monotheism by asserting that gods other than YHWH are impotent idols;

There is also an Egyptian diaspora: the Elephantine military colony assimilates with Egyptians, but keeps contact with Jerusalem and Samaria, and has a temple for syncretic worship condemned by Jeremiah

~~~~~~~~

Job Rebuked by his Friends

0550 The Book of Job is written with its fascinating Theodice and portrayal of Satan as opposing counsel chatting with the LORD and cajoling Him into destroying the life of Job. Evolution of Theodice: why do bad things happen to good people? 1. Free will - It’s not God's fault; you somehow deserve it.  Asked why God allows cruelty against children, Pope Francis responded that people have free will; interestingly, the abuser has free will, not the abused.

2. Redemptive - God tests us to find the limits of our faith. 3. Mystery - It's all part of the plan that you can’t understand. 4. Divine love - God punishes those he loves. (My favorite) 5. Deuteronomistic - Group punishment for the sin of one/a few; namely, the failure of a ruler to obey God (as interpreted by priests) - a theory devised by … priests!

6. Apocalyptic - The Zoroastrian (Persian) idea that the world is dualistic - either good or evil - and that now, since no other theory seems valid, it is dominated by evil. But suffering will be vanquished at the end of time, when the Davidic Messiah will expel the strangers, resurrect the dead, reward the good, punish the evil, and rule in righteousness until Judgment Day. (Don’t hold your breath.)

The Persian Era

0539 Cyrus II captures Babylon - The Persian era will last until Alexander in 0332. Under Persia, the exiles are allowed to return from Babylon, rebuild the temple with the Zadokite High Priest as ruler, though many exiles stay in Babylon. The Persian era lays the foundations for the unified Judaic religion and the beginning of a scriptural canon.  The Davidic Zerubbabel is appointed Governor of Yehud, exciting Messianic hopes. Zecheriah: ‘He is chosen by god, redemption is imminent,’ and so he is relieved of his duties (and killed?) by the Persians.

0515 The <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Temple_period">Second Temple is consecrated. The period</A> is characterized by strict <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotheism">monotheism,</A> the emergence of beliefs regarding <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel">angels</A> and <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon">demons,</A> and the increasingly important institution of the synagogue. Yehud becomes a theocracy ruled by hereditary high priests, with a Persian-appointed governor, frequently Jewish, charged with keeping order and seeing that taxes are paid. The city is refortified, and Judean life is reformed. Biblical sources focus almost exclusively on highly Yahwistic exilic returnees, with no information on returnees before Nehemiah: it may have been more desirable to stay in Babylon, as Josephus relates, many were “unwilling to leave their property.”

0445 Nehemiah, Cupbearer to the Persian King, with the status of a Persian royal governor, on the order of Artaxerxes executes Jewish law, rebuilds the walls of Jerusalem, and demands a pure genealogy from those who wish to worship at the Temple. He brings strict Yahwism based on Deuteronomy, restores the Levites, enforces the Sabbath, and demands that foreign wives and children be sent away: Judaism is born, along with the Samaritan schism. Nehemiah also alleviates the exploitation of the poor, who were selling family members into slavery and were paying usurious interest on loans made contrary to the law, then he returns to Persian court to defend himself.These returnees, though they waited nearly one hundred years to leave Babylon, bear great disdain for those who stayed in Yehud, based partly on the exclusivism that the exiles developed while in Babylon and also partly on disputes over property.  But wait! Didn’t Nehemiah rule after Ezra? Not according to the times in office of the high priests: Eliashib under Nehemiah (Neh 3:1,20; 13:4),

Nehemiah Rebuilds the Walls of Jerusalem

and Jehohanan under Ezra (10:6).

0407 Jews of Elephantine (Egypt) appeal for help rebuilding their temple, but are denied. 0398 Ezra, part of the Babylonian Revival, returns to Jerusalem, has the Torah read. Under Ezra, Judaism becomes a religion of the book, with reading as important as sacrifice as an act of worship. Ezra may have been the first ‘rabbi,’ though he preached neither end of days, nor Davidic preference, nor blatant nationalism.

0350 Chron  rewrites Biblical stories strongly to David’s advantage.

0340  Samarian leader Sanbalat supports Alexander against Persia; Alexander is victorious, and so the Samaritan Joseph tribes (Manassah, Ephraim) are allowed to build a Temple on Mt. Gorizim (Nablus). Greek culture spreads with Alexander’s victory over Persia.

Alexander and Hellenism

0332 <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great">Alexander the Great</A> conquers Persia. On Alexander’s death in 323, his general Seleucus takes the Fertile Crescent, and Ptolemy takes Egypt. Similarities between Jesus and Alexander: divine adoption, dual divine- human parentage, virgin birth, universal transformative mission, death at 33, deification. Conquest of the Holy Land by yet another foreign power in spite of the piety of the state (barring foreign wives and foreign gods), leads to a rejection of the Deuteronomist view and the emergence of Messianic Apocalypticism in the prophet Daniel.

Alexander in the Temple of Jerusalem

Alexander brings a flood of new settlers into the area, creating a new political-social reality - Hellenism: Greek becomes the lingua franca; a new scientific, literary and legal environment emerges; the personal philosophy of Stoicism helps individuals to cope with a confused social reality; religious syncretism becomes the basis of the dominant common culture among the upper classes of these regions until Islam in the 7th</span><span class="cls_003"> century CE. Universalism</span></div (peaceful coexistence) is the new standard, but is emphatically rejected by Yahwistic Jews, who are portrayed by the civilized world as misanthropic and inhumane. Jews’ refusal to worship the Emperor, and their habit of sending money to Jerusalem mark them for suspicion as a fifth column.

Maccabees oppose Antiochus IV

0300 Traditionalists vs. Hellenizers: A prolonged internal struggle begins, manifest early in disputes over the calendar. The common core of Judaism is determined: God as an active element in history, the Torah, support for the Temple, establishment of synagogues, dietary laws, circumcision, the Sabbath, exclusive Yahwism.

~~~~~~~~

28







Synagogues and Rabbis

0250 1 Enoch is written, of which an Ethiopic text is later found at Qumran. Themes include for the first time many of the accoutrements of later Christian belief: a solar calendar, angels, heaven and hell, Son of Man existent before creation, judgment after death, resurrection of believers - ideas also reflected in Daniel 12:2.

0230 Synagogues: Though perhaps mentioned by Ezekiel “I will be a comfort to them,” and though Ezra led readings of the Torah, congregational meetings are not regular until the first synagogue, most likely the proseuche - prayer (venue) begun in Egypt during the reign of Ptolemy III, at which meetings there are a priest and an elder (rabbi), where diaspora communities gather to read the Torah under a leader (Acts). Synagogues will not be introduced to Judea until 0070 CE. Access to God is no longer the exclusive prerogative of the priests.

0200 Sadducees (“descendants of Zadok”) believe that people have total free will, that there is no after life (like Epicureans, though here an outgrowth of the Zadokite teaching that one should serve God as though no wage - Heaven - were paid), that written tradition can come only from Moses, that ‘legitimate’ priests must take back their rights from the Hasmoneans. Sadducees are, however, wealthy and alienated from the common people.

0200 Pharisees (Aramaic “separated ones”) believe that some things are determined by fate and others by will, so divine reward/punishment are deserved since we are somewhat responsible. Why then is there no justice? There must be justice in an afterworld - similar to Stoicism, and the oral tradition from Moses, the first “rabbi”; the message attracts the lower classes (quite close to that of the Christians, so the conflict between Pharisees and Christians will be so bitter). Because of their affinity to the masses, they are authorized to determine Temple practices for Sadducees.

The Septuagint (LXX)

Greek-speaking Jews need a translation of the Bible into Greek, the Septuagint, in which certain liberties are taken: themes of the after-life are introduced; Proverbs is translated very freely; certain factual inconsistencies emerge: the enemies of Israel, who had been Aramaeans and Philistines are now Syrians and coastal Greek cities; words assume new meanings; there is a reluctance to refer to anthropomorphism - in Isaiah 38:11 ‘the Lord’ becomes ‘salvation,’ Exodus 24:10 ‘the Lord’ becomes ‘the place’; mistakes abound: Isaiah 7:14 ‘alma - young woman’ becomes ‘parthenos - virgin.’ This one error alone leads to millennia of creative theologizing). Some Jewish scholars contend that only the Pentateuch is translated under divine guidance, hence only those translations are accurate.

One egregious example of rampant translation error is Isaiah Chapter Three, in which there are 41 translation errors. I have highlighted only a few verses below. My favorite is ‘transparent Spartan dresses’ for ‘crisping pins.’ The format below is:   Hebrew Masoretic Text, King James Version (generally correct),

Emergence of Messianic Apocalyticism

0200 Messianism independent of Apocalypticism emerges. The Machabees avoid references to Messianism

because they are not Davidic, but were usurpers. Messianism is intended to be restorative, directed inward, and in accord with natural laws. Sometimes theory has two Messiahs: a king and a priest, Moses and Aaron. Apocalypticism is, on the other hand, utopian, eschatological, directed outward, supernatural, not necessarily Messianic; the Messiah would gather the banished Is 11:12.

Participatory Messianism

0198 Antiochus III (Seleucid) takes Jerusalem after a siege, then allows the Jews to remain largely self-governing.

Ethics are to be governed by ancestral laws; Jewish elites align with the foreign occupiers (again).

0189 The Seleucids are defeated by Rome at Magnesia. Yet another foreign invader is at the door. 0187-0175 Seleucus IV succeeds Antiochus, and loots the Jerusalem temple to pay reparations to Rome. Good

relations with the Jewish aristocracy are harmed. Hellenization is widespread among the upper classes, as indicated by the prevalence of Greek names. Religious and social conservatives conflict with Hellenizers.

0186 In order to unite his ruled territories, Antiochus III imposes paganism on the Jews. 0180 Joshuah Ben Sirach cites the Torah and Prophets as the Jewish canon to which, once definitively established,

no new works can be added.

0176 The Heliodorus Affair - High Priest Onius III is accused by a certain Simon of under-reporting tax income

to the Seleucids; Heliodorus is sent by Antiochus III to Jerusalem and conducts an audit; Onius III goes to the Seleucid capital of Antioch to make his case; Antiochus III is assassinated; Antiochus IV takes over.

0175 Antiochus IV Epiphanes. The position of Jewish High Priest is bought by a certain Jason, who then

Hellenizes Jerusalem and renames the city Antioch in honor of Antiochus IV.

0172 High Priest Jason is replaced by Menelaus, a far more radical Hellenizer, who seeks to bring Jews into the

mainstream of Greek social and political life.

0168 Antiochus invades Egypt to achieve his dream of a united Hellenist East. At the gates of Alexandria he is

ordered to withdraw by the Roman ambassador, Gaius Popillius Laenas. Antiochus says he must think about it, upon which Laenas draws a line in the sand around Antiochus and replies, “You’ll think about it here!” Antiochus withdraws and rumors are spread that he has died. Conservatives in Jerusalem depose Menelaus and undo the Hellenizing reforms. Antiochus isn’t dead, suppresses the revolt brutally, brings a Greek garrison into Jerusalem, introduces pagan rites into the Temple, and outlaws Jewish customs. Jewish martyrs arise: Mattathias (Hasmonean) refuses to worship the Greek gods, and sparks a revolt in Jerusalem. His son, Judah Machabee (the Hammer) leads a guerrilla war against the Seleucids.

~~~~~~~~

31







The Machabees

0167 Judah Machabee besieges the Greek garrison in Jerusalem 0167 The Book of Daniel is composed and written back into the days of the Babylonian captivity. Continued domination by a parade of foreign powers in spite of the piety of the priests and people discredits the Deuteronomist view and heralds the emergence of Apocalypticism. The characteristics of apocalyptic works are: pseudonymity - visions are attributed to figures from the past; numerical symbolism; secret language - contemporary rulers referred to by past rulers; animal symbolism; doctrine of angels; division of history into periods (of which the Greek is the fourth and final); references to the coming time; and belief in one or more Messiahs who would deliver Israel from foreign domination (a point conveniently overlooked by Christians).

0164 The Machabean rebels are victorious. Jonathan Machabee becomes High Priest, though he is not a Zadokite, and purifies the Temple - the origin of Hanukkah. The Zadokites then evolve into 1) the Egyptian Leontopolis cult under Onius IV, 2) Jerusalem’s Sadducees, and 3) the Essenes of the Qumran sect. Some see this period also as a civil war between orthodox and <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_Judaism">Hellenized Jews.</A> Hasmonean kings attempt to revive the Judah described in the Bible: a Jewish monarchy ruling from Jerusalem over all territories once ruled by David and Solomon. In order to carry out this project, the <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasmonean">Hasmoneans</A> forcibly convert Moabites, Edomites, and Ammonites, as well as the lost kingdom of Israel (Samaritans) to Judaism.

Antiochus seeks to eradicate the Jewish Religion

0161 Judah Machabee renews the treaty with Rome to weaken Hellenism; Jews assert their nationalism. 0150 Testaments of the Patriarchs - a text is written of ‘the speeches that should have been made.’ Levi and Judah are associated as dual Messiah figures.

0150 Jubilees - a text retelling stories within a framework of seven years, with the use of a solar calendar, written in Ethiopic, containing many historical anachronisms and talking animals.

0142 The Seleucids free Hasmonean Judea from paying taxes to the Empire. The Machabees are recognized as a new dynasty “until a new prophet shall arise,” … or the Romans (63 BCE).

0134-0104 John Horchanus I succeeds his father Simon Machabee. Besieged in Jerusalem by the Seleucid Antiochus VII, he first removes, then readmits non-combatants. The walls of Jerusalem are broken down. After the death of Antiochus VII, the Seleucid Empire begins to break up. Horchanus robs the Tomb of David to support a mercenary army, by which he expands his kingdom (Idumea), destroys the (schismatic) Samaritan temple (111 BCE), and forces conversions of non-Jewish populations, among whom is the grandfather of Herod the Great.

0130 1 Machabees in Hebrew relates Jewish history 175-135 BCE. Mattathias, like Phineas in Numbers, gives legitimacy to Hasmoneans.

0120 2 Machabees in Greek relates the ideology of martyrdom, resurrection, Judaism, Hellenism, and how Jews can live in the diaspora.

~~~~~~~~

32







The Essenes: (the Dead Sea Scroll sect?)

0120 believe that all is decided by fate (no free will). They separate themselves from the vulgar, impure priesthood and people, and bear many similarities to Christians: baptism, contemporizing prophecies, solar calendar, communal organization, Messianic vocabulary, apocalypticism, predestination, and dualism. They avoid the corrupt city and expect a Davidic Messiah and a future world (Daniel) in which the Davidic monarchy is guaranteed forever (Is 11:6, Jeremiah 23, Zechariah).  Then God’s wrath will cease and He will establish a new covenant with them alone. The Dead Sea Scrolls: The War Scroll - in a final battle, setbacks are to be expected, but God’s intervention will be decisive. Pesher are texts with contemporary interpolation of prophecies. The sect goes extinct after the Fall of Jerusalem (70 CE).

0104-0103 Aristobolus I conquers Galilee, forces conversion to Judaism of Galileans. 0103-0076 Alexander Jannaeus (Greek name) defeats a rebellion, banquets as the rebels’ wives and children of the rebels are killed in front of the crucified rebels. The Hasmoneans have themselves become thoroughly Hellenized.

0076 Salome Alexandra, wife of Alexander, becomes regent and empowers the Pharisees against the Saducees, whom she removes from Jerusalem.

0067 Hasmonean Civil War: Alexandra dies and her two sons Hyrcanus II and Aristobolus II both seek Roman help. The two trade titles as the Romans solidify their rule over Judea.

0066 Rebellion: Cataclysm is imminent: should zealots themselves light the fuse (Pharisees) or will all happen according to the Divine Plan (Sadducees)? Ethnic and social tensions erupt (some burn debt records); Rome aids its allies, the aristocrats. After initial successes for the rebels, Vespasian isolates Jerusalem. Yohanan ben Zakkai escapes in a coffin, meets Vespasian, predicts his kingship. Vespasian is pleased, and asks what ben Zakkai wants, to which he replies “Give me only Yavne (anachronistic, the town was not yet built) and its wise men (not the priests?!).” Ben Zakkai establishes the first synagogue in Judea,

Roman Period

0063 The Roman general Pompey conquers this last nominally independent kingdom of <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judea">Judea.</A>  0048 Pompey is defeated by Julius Caesar in 48, and Antipater of Edom becomes the first Roman Procurator. 0045 Jews refuse to assimilate. Jewish law tries to separate Jews from gentiles to prevent Jews from adopting idolatrous behaviors. In Jewish law, a gentile is grouped together with dishonest butchers, gamblers, usurers and thieves who cannot act as witnesses; and charity from non-Jews is not to be accepted. Dietary laws also limit social interactions; e.g., food cooked by non-Jews is prohibited; hence, Shakespeare’s Shylock: “I will not eat with you.” 0044 Caesar is assassinated and Quintus Labienus, Roman general and ambassador to the Parthians (Persians), sides with the Liberators (Caesar’s assassins), and assists the Parthians in invading Roman territories. 0040 Parthians overrun Syria and Palestine and empower Antigonus. Herod (son of Antipater) goes to Rome, befriends Marc Antony, and is declared King of the Jews by the Roman Senate. 0037 Herod the Great expels the Parthians, retakes Judea, eliminates the Hasmoneans, and installs a Babylonian as High Priest. Alexandra, the mother of his Hasmonean wife Mariomne, is upset, so she contacts Cleopatra VII to have Marc Antony appoint her son, Aristobulus III, as High Priest. He is appointed, and is enthusiastically supported by the people, but Herod feels threatened, and so kills Aristobulus. 0031 The Battle of Actium. Octavian defeats Marc Antony and Cleopatra VII; Herod meets with Octavian, convinces Octavian to keep him as king, and executes a brutal repression. He kills his beloved wife Meriomne, her mother Alexandra, and Meriomne’s Hasmonean sons. This, or the example of Alexander Jannaeus, is likely the inspiration for the tale of the Holy Innocents. Herod further fills Jerusalem with Hellenistic architecture, expands the Temple, and brings in diaspora priests.

Herod greets the Three Kings

0004 BCE Herod the Great dies, leaving three sons, all named Herod: 1) Herod Archelaus succeeds his father as ruler in Judea, Idumea, and Samaria. 2) Herod Philip rules Golan, marries Herodias, lives until 34; 3) Herod Antipas rules in Galilee and Parea until 39, marries Herodias (his late brother Philip’s widow), and executes John the Baptist. Jesus is born.

Common Era (AD) 0006 Herod Archelaus is judged incompetent and is removed as the last <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnarch">ethnarch.</A>  ; a Roman prefect (later Pontius Pilate) is brought in. Quirinius, Governor of Syria, assesses property for taxation purposes (the ‘census’ in Luke). The territories of Judea are combined with those of <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idumea">Idumea</A> and <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaria">Samaria</A> and governed as Judaea Province under direct <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_empire">Roman</A> administration. The government is moved to Caesarea Maritima, which has better communications. Organized resistance to Rome begins: Judah of Gamila and Zadok the Pharisee (proponent of the Fourth Philosophy) preach that ‘subservience to Rome is idolatry.’

John and Jesus

0025 John the Baptist, an Apocalyptic preacher, feeds the hopes of Apocalyptic Jews who are expecting a human Messiah descended from David to rule over an independent restored kingdom of Israel.

0029 Herod Antipas marries Herodias (who had divorced his brother Philip), and executes John the Baptist, either because he objected to Antipas’ marriage to Herodias, or because John was an eloquent revolutionary, fond of quoting Is 40:3 “prepare the way.”

0030 Ministry of Jesus - (See Part Two for a discussion of the criteria used to ferret out the “Historical Jesus.”) Jesus is born in Nazareth (a backward village so insignificant it is not mentioned once in the Hebrew Scriptures or Josephus) to Mary and Joseph (Joseph is never heard from again) around 4 BC, and had siblings - both brothers (James et al), and sisters (Mk 3:31). He is born and raised as a Jew, in an area of Galilee that had been forcibly converted to Judaism by Aristobolus I in 104 BCE.

Jesus was most probably trained to be a tekton - carpenter, or construction worker of some sort, and seems to have been drawn to the apocalyptic teaching of his “cousin” (Luke 1:36), John the Baptist. Beginning with his baptism by John, Jesus taught an Apocalyptic message.

In Matthew, Jesus’ first recorded preaching (4:17 Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.) is a direct quote from John and Jesus seems to have been guided into thinking of himself as the Messiah by his desire to fulfill John’s expectations.He began his ministry in his native Galilee, but was not well received either by his family (Mk 3:21,31, John 7:5, Paul 1Cor 15) or the neighboring towns of Galilee (Mk 6:1, Lk 4, L 10, M 11). Though the chief Galilean cities of Cepherus and Tiberius were within walking distance, Jesus is never recorded as having gone there. He is a prophet without honor (Mk, John, Thomas), who had no home (Mk 8, Lk 9, John 15:18). Much in the mold of Isaiah, he shares John’s contempt for the Pharisees (Jews who emphasize minute adherence to the letter rather than the spirit of the Law) and Sadducees (“smug” priests of the Temple in Jerusalem and collaborators with Rome), and is concerned for the long-suffering multitudes.

He goes to Jerusalem at Passover apparently to cement his reputation as a prophet and to make his theological points, perhaps even to incite an armed uprising. He overturns the tables of money-changers and, as intended, attracts the unfavorable attention of the Jewish authorities by disrupting Temple activities and preaching the imminent arrival of the apocalyptic Kingdom of Heaven.

He is betrayed by his disciple Judas, who likely tells the Roman authorities that Jesus is claiming to be the Messiah and future ruler of Palestine. He is arrested (while with his band of armed “zealots”), tried by Pontius Pilate, crucified, and probably dies on the cross, though Josephus tells of two men who survived crucifixion. Details of his death are inconsistent (see notes below on Matthew 28). As for his “resurrection,” he is most likely buried in a mass grave, as was the usual Roman custom for those guilty of treason.

Jesus’ Teachings

are best summarized by the Sermon on the Mount with the Beatitudes and Antitheses: Jesus on love: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself,’ a sentiment already present in Leviticus. Also, in stark contrast to Nahum 1:2 ‘The lord takes vengeance on his adversaries (Gentiles) and rages against his enemies,’ and the beliefs of the Qumran sect that one should love certain people (our sect), hate everyone else (even Jews), Jesus proposes loving one’s enemies.

Jesus also broke with convention by consciously associating with women and repentant sinners rather than with the proudly self-righteous; he preferred the attitude of sinful humility to that of smug spiritual superiority.

Regarding salvation, Matthew 25, discussed in greater detail below, is Jesus’ clearest doctrinal pronouncement. With its unambiguous endorsement of “works,” it directly contradicts later Pauline emphasis on “faith.”

Jesus was doubtless an Apocalypticist. The earliest sources - Q, Mark, M, Lk, and Paul - are all apocalyptic (cf, 1Enoch 69, Dan 7:13ff, Paul 1Cor 15:23, 1Thess 4:16ff, Mk 1:15, 8:38, 9:1!, 13:24ff, 13:30!, 14:62, Matthew 25:13; 19:28! (twelve thrones), Luke 17:24, 12:40). Apocalypticism was a widespread philosophical school in 1st</span><span class="cls_003"> century</span></div Palestine, which asserted that: the world is clearly divided between the powers of good and evil, that they then lived in an age of evil, that nothing can save the world except the direct intervention of God, that God’s intervention is imminent (Mk 9:1), that the beginning of God’s intervention will be signaled by resurrection of the good who suffered and the evil who inflicted suffering to face judgment. After it becomes evident that the Coming is not imminent, the message is changed: Mark 9:1 was toned down to Lk17:20. Then John 11:23 modifies it even further, saying that resurrection occurs whenever one had faith.

Reaction to the Crucifixion

0033 After Jesus' sudden and shocking death, his followers spread his message and embellish or invent stories of his life. Our challenge is to separate the aspects of this remarkable life which are more likely to be historical from those that are not. Especially suspect are stories that feature angels, dreams, miracles, predictions of the future, and fulfillment of prophecies. Sometimes actual stories are embellished with miraculous features. Healing the sick and raising the dead may be examples of this. It is possible that people experienced a placebo effect merely from the touch of the holy man, similar to the effect of the Elder Zossima in Brothers Karamazov or the effect of Caesar's presence upon his soldiers as described in Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. It is also possible that Jesus mastered some of the magical tricks of the prophetic trade and impressed the mobs as can Penn and Teller. It is important to note that magic was a staple of the period and even Simon Magus was seen flying in the book of Acts. It is likewise no wonder that believers whose fundamental faith is based upon a miracle (the Resurrection) should have no qualms about mythologizing the life of their leader. After his death, convinced, in spite of overwhelming evidence to the contrary, that Jesus was the Messiah, believers pored over the Jewish Scriptures searching for any prophecy regarding the Messiah and write the fulfillment of those prophecies back into the life of Jesus, changing details wherever instructed by the "Holy Spirit."

As for Jesus’ elevation to the status as God, the early Christian community believe that he was deified upon his resurrection as attested by Pre-literary Traditions (terse statements in tightly structured formats with parallel statements).

One such fragment appears in Paul:

Romans 1<A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Romans-1-3/">:3</A> Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh; <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Romans-1-4/">4</A> And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:

Paul was planning a mission to Spain and required the help of the Christian community in Rome. Here he is trying to show that he is of one spirit with them by appealing to an earlier statement of faith, using phrases not characteristic of Paul (‘seed of David,’ ‘spirit of holiness,’ and not reflective of his beliefs (Jesus becoming the son of God at Resurrection).

Two more appear in Acts:

Acts 2:36 Peter: Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made the same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ. Acts 13:33 Paul: God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second Psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.

Acts (written 80-85 AD) furthermore cannot be a record of the actual speeches, as Peter, an illiterate Aramaic- speaker, sounds just like Paul, an educated Greek-speaker.

For the evangelist Mark, Jesus was adopted by God at his baptism. Such adoption was common in the Roman world (cf, Octavian). As the community develops and the gospels are written, the divinization of Jesus is pushed further and further back: from the resurrection for the pre-literary tradition, to baptism for Mark, to his birth for Matthew and Luke, and finally to the moment of creation for John.

Jesus and James vs Paul and Augustine

What is Jesus’ teaching regarding salvation? Jesus here gives a clear protocol for salvation; namely, to help those in need, even anonymously.

Matthew 25 - Parable of the Sheep and Goats

Mt 25:31 When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: 25:32 And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats: 25:33 And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. 25:34 Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: 25:35 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: 25:36 Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me. 25:37 Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?  25:38 When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?  25:39 Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?  25:40 And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me. 25:41 Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye

cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels: 25:42 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink: 25:43 I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not. 25:44 Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?  25:45 Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me. 25:46 And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.

According to Jesus’ explanation of salvation here, his crucifixion is not necessary; baptism of the saved person is not

necessary; even recognition of Jesus’ identity is not necessary, much less faith or belief in any doctrine other than helping those in need.  On the other hand, turning away from those in need, which so-called Christians find easy today, is condemned in terms just as clear.

James the Just

Who leads the Jerusalem Church after Jesus’ sudden, violent  death? According to Acts, it is Peter, but Paul lists James prior to “Cephas” (Peter) and John as those considered "pillars" of the Jerusalem Church. Further, Eusebius records that Clement of Alexandria wrote that Peter, James, and John chose James, the brother of Jesus, as bishop of Jerusalem. As is made clear in his Epistle, James emphasizes Jesus’ doctrine of salvation by ‘works.’

from the Epistle of James

2<A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-14/">:14 What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-14/">he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-15/">15 If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-15/">food, 16 And one of you say unto them, Depart in</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-16/">peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-16/">them not those things which are needful to the body;</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-16/">what doth it profit? 17 Even so faith, if it hath not works,</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-17/">is dead, being alone. 18 Yea, a man may say, Thou hast</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-18/">faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-18/">works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works. 19</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-19/">Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well:</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-19/">the devils also believe, and tremble. 20 But wilt thou</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-20/">know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead? 21</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-21/">Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-21/">he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar? 22 Seest</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-22/">thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-22/">was faith made perfect? 23 And the scripture was</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-23/">fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-23/">was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was</A>

called the Friend of God. <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-24/">24 Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-25/">25 Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers,</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-25/">and had sent them out another way? 26 For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-26/">works is dead also.</A>

This epistle was specifically written to contradict Paul, who was then proselytizing salvation by faith alone. James and Paul also differed over whether to preach to Gentiles, widening the rift in the early church, as indicated in Galatians 2:9ff.

Paul of Tarsus, an apocalyptic Pharisee of the diaspora community in Asia Minor, initially feels that Christian claims that Jesus is the Messiah are absurd to the point of being blasphemous. He is very intelligent and well read in the Septuagint (the source of all his quotations of Scripture). He participates in the suppression of the Christians and may well have been present at the martyrdom of St. Stephen. On the road to Damascus he has a nervous breakdown, due probably to the echoes of Isaiah condemning oppression of the poor ringing in his ears, since early Christian communities were most likely comprised largely of the socio-politically disadvantaged.

His breakdown is likely also, considering his later hostility

to the Jewish Law, a result of his view that Pharisaic obsession with minutiae of the Law of Moses is superfluous to the central Biblical message of the Two Great Commandments to love God and one’s neighbor. During his seizure he has a vision of the resurrected Jesus from whom he learns “his gospel.” He then fastidiously avoids going to see other Apostles for three years, during which time he formulates his message, the gist of which is as follows: 1. Jesus rose from the dead, hence he is blessed of God, not cursed as would be anyone “hanged upon a tree.” 2. Since he is blessed, his death must have been directed by God; it cannot have been a random event. 3. His death must be a sacrifice; but he is blameless, so it must be a sacrifice for others. 4. Others must therefore be guilty, but of what? Ah, the sin of Adam (original sin) must have universal effect. 5. How can we benefit from this sacrifice? Only by baptism, whereby we are cleansed of Adam’s sin and may

receive God’s grace.

6. Is that enough? No, we must consciously accept and believe in Jesus’ sacrifice; otherwise we won’t be saved. 7. Isn’t it enough to help those in need, as Jesus taught in the Parable of the Sheep and Goats? No, if that were

sufficient, then Jesus would not have been required to die on the cross.

This entire system of ideas was constructed to defend Paul’s cherished belief that Jesus’ crucifixion was necessary. All the rest of the elaborate tissue emerges from this one flawed tenet.

When Paul encounters resistance from Jews who do not share his deviant reading of Jewish Scripture, he reacts by taking his message to Gentiles. That he was a convincing speaker is undeniable. In certain cases, people (e.g., his jailer) seem to have been “converted” without having the slightest understanding of what he preached.

Indeed, Paul himself could not willfully contradict Jesus’ teaching because he simply did not know Jesus’ teaching. When he wrote his Epistles (~50CE) there were as yet no gospels and he avoided contact with the Apostles. What his writings reflect  about Jesus is limited to: the fact that Jesus was Jewish, was born of a woman, had a brother named James, taught his followers to pay their preachers and not to divorce, performed the Last Supper, and was crucified. He never quotes Jesus, even when discussing an issue about which Jesus spoke convincingly . He never says, “Jesus taught,” but always “I taught.” If we compare Jesus’ teachings to Paul’s, discrepancies are evident:

While both Jesus and Paul were apocalypticists who taught love of God and of neighbor, Jesus taught turning the other cheek, while Paul bitterly attacked his enemies; Jesus spurned Mammon, while Paul sought and cultivated the wealthy; Jesus felt disgust with the self-righteous, while Paul built a ‘righteous’ church bureaucracy; Jesus preached the imminence of the end, as did Paul at first, but when the end didn’t come, Paul adjusted his message; Jesus associated with sinners, while Paul associated with “believers”; Jesus taught salvation through good works, while Paul taught salvation through baptism and faith; Jesus lived as a Jew, while Paul rejected the Law and lived “as a Greek”; Jesus taught Jews to “follow the Law,” while Paul vehemently forbade  Gentile converts to follow the Law.”

Suppression of the Jamesian Ebionites

So were there any believers in the early days who followed the teachings of Jesus and James? Yes, the Ebionites (“the poor”) follow James, are observant of the Jewish Law and rites, stress poverty and good works, and regard Jesus of Nazareth as “a prophet, the biological son of Mary and Joseph, who by virtue of his righteousness, was chosen by God to be a messianic prophet like Moses when he was anointed with the Holy Spirit at his baptism by John.”  They rejected Jesus’ pre-existence, divinity, virgin birth, atoning death, and physical resurrection. They use only the gospel of Matthew starting at chapter 3, revere James the brother of Jesus (James the Just), and reject Paul the Apostle as an apostate from the Law. They place a special value on voluntary poverty. ‘Ebionim’ is also among the terms used by the sect at Qumran (possibly Essenes) that sought to separate itself from the corruption of the Temple. The earliest reference to a group that might fit the description of the later Ebionites appears in Justin Martyr's Dialogue with Trypho (c. 140), while Irenaeus (c. 180) was probably the first to use the term "Ebionites" to describe the ‘heretical judaizing sect,’ which he regarded as stubbornly clinging to the Law. (This first mention does not mean that they emerged in 180CE, but only that they then became a problem for the proto-

Heretic books burned by Papal decree

Orthodox.)

~~~~~~~

After James’ death, a struggle ensues between the followers of James (‘faith without works is dead’) and those of Paul. The church in Jerusalem chooses Paul’s “gospel” and turns orthodox, likely because Paul’s version of salvation requires a devoted, sacramental, priestly, paternalistic hierarchy (a church), while Jesus’ and James’ version does not. Anyone who attacks the prerogatives of the Church by asserting the teachings of Jesus and James is branded a heretic, which brings us to the great contest between Pelagius and Augustine of Hippo.

~~~~~~~

0041 Herod Agrippa (Herod the Great’s grandson, friend of the Emperor Claudius) takes over as king. A Hasmonean, he shows reverence for local customs; the people have a brief respite of good government.

0044 Agrippa dies suddenly; Governors are back; relations deteriorate; rebellion and false prophets pop up: Thelgas, the Egyptian.

Augustine of Hippo (354-430)

is best known for his ideas on the relationship between the will, grace, and predestination. Raised as a Christian by his mother, Monica, he reads Hortensius and becomes Manichaean. In 370 he begins a thirteen- year relationship with the mother (never named in his works) of his son, Adeodatus (born 372). In 383 he moves to Rome, is exposed to neo-Platonic idealism, and rejects Manichaeism. His mother joins him in Milan, forces him to send his child’s mother away, and arranges a marriage for him to a 10-year old Christian heiress. In 386 Augustine renounces his career and marriage, and is baptized by St. Ambrose. Augustine's core ideas even after his reconversion still reflect Manichaean concepts: Hell, Elect and Reprobates, hostility to the flesh and sexual activity, and dualistic theology. In 389, he writes Confessions, sells his patrimony, and gives the

 <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Consecration_of_Saint_Augustine">Consecration of Saint Augustine</A>

money to the poor. In 391 he is drafted as priest at Thagaste, near Carthage. In 410, Rome is sacked by Visigoths, and Christians are blamed for their unmanly, pacifist behavior, in answer to which he writes City of God.

The Pelagian Controversy:  Pelagius, a British monk, asserts that people are not born with a “sinful nature” and thus do not require the “cleansing” of infant baptism.  He claims that people can choose to live a good life or a bad life, and can thus choose salvation or damnation. He sees in Jesus not an atoning death “to wash away the sins of the world,” but merely a divine model of virtuous life. He considers death to be natural to all men (since baptism doesn’t confer immortality). Like Pelagius, many early Church Fathers taught that humans have the power of free will and the choice over good and evil: Justin Martyr - "every created being is so constituted as to be capable of vice and virtue. For he can do nothing praiseworthy, if he had not the power of turning either way." Theophilus   - "If, on the other hand, he would turn to the things of death, disobeying God, he would himself be the cause of death to himself. For God made man free, and with power of himself." Irenaeus - "But man, being endowed with reason, and in this respect similar to God, having been made free in his will, and with power over himself, is himself his own cause that sometimes he becomes wheat, and sometimes chaff." Clement of Alexandria  - "We...have believed and are saved by voluntary choice." Before Pelagius, even Augustine suggested that the will is confronted by a rational choice between a life spent in the pursuit of what is temporal, changing, and perishable, and a life spent in the pursuit of what is eternal, immutable, and incapable of being lost [De Libero Arbitrio I.7]; and that God's grace is "a reward for human assent,” that will is independent to choose good or evil, and that salvation is thus in the hands of the believer. However, as Pelagianism spreads rapidly, especially around Carthage, Augustine changes his tune and reacts to this attack upon the sacraments by accusing Pelagius of heresy at the Council of Carthage in 418. Augustine’s logic is similar to Paul’s: if good deeds can save us, why did Jesus have to die on the cross? To defeat Pelagius and uphold the Sacramental Church, Augustine devises a system whereby salvation is gained only by “irresistible” divine will; namely, that people have no choice. Likewise, damnation is the result of divine grace withheld, in which case people again have no choice. “Grace irresistibly changes our will so that those chosen cannot reject it, and those from whom it is withheld cannot be saved.”  [De Gratia et Libero Arbitrio xx and xxi]. Augustine is even pushed by the absurdity of his position to argue that unbaptized babies, and by extension miscarried or aborted babies, burn in Hell for all eternity. Also, misreading Genesis, Augustine maintains that death is a consequence of original sin (yet it is curiously not remedied by baptism or Jesus’ crucifixion). In order to maintain its monopoly on the machinery of salvation, the Church endorses Augustine.

The Gospel (not by</span><span class="cls_003"> Mark, but) </span><span class="cls_022">according to</span><span class="cls_003"> Mark</span></div

The first Gospel is written - Jesus is portrayed as the misunderstood prophet (Adoptionism). In Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus the gospel actually ends at 16:8, as noted by Eusebius and Jerome, though Irenaeus (200 CE) cites verse 19, demonstrating that the early Church Fathers probably made the addition in order to harmonize Mark with the other gospels. Mark 16:8 ‘And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any man; for they were afraid.’

0065 Sources of Gospel stories: The Gospels are written by those inspired by the Holy Spirit (i.e., IMAGINATION!). For example, when they read in Micah that the Messiah rose out of Egypt, of course the Spirit makes them think it must be Jesus who rose out of Egypt, so Matt 2:13 puts him in Egypt.

Often gospel stories mirror those of the pagan faiths around them. For example, the immaculate conception of Plato, whose mother Perictione was impregnated by Apollo, who declared to Ariston, to whom she was betrothed, the parentage of the child; the story of an evil serpent sent to ruin paradise was taught to the Jews by the Babylonians during the Captivity; also, the ideas of resurrection, the immortality of the soul, and dualism were taught not by Jews, but by Persians and incorporated into the Judaeo-Christian mythology during the Persian period of occupation.

Where is God? The First Jewish-Roman War - The Second Temple is destroyed

Judaism again loses its raison d’être. This is a huge shock to the fundamental system of Judaism. 0070 Diaspora is considered the ultimate punishment for people fallen away from God, but the Babylonian community is a success. With Hellenism, borders disappear, and Jews follow business opportunities, and actually convert some Gentiles. Because Babylon is outside the Hellenist world, its Jewish community keeps its exclusionist identity. Philo: ‘The diaspora is the realization of God’s promise to Abraham.’

0070 Rabbis: With the Temple gone - who’s in charge? Yohanan Ben Zakkai (30 BC-90 AD) - ‘When in doubt, plant a tree.’ Ritual is modified, as is use of the shofar, which thitherto could only be sounded in the Temple. The new rabbinical model is based not on birth, but vocation. Rabbis are mobile and establish local centers; the nature of ritual is changed from sacrifice to reading and prayer in synagogues. Then Rabban Gamaliel (Acts 5:34) establishes a bureaucracy, supports Rome, and is named patriarch. Prayer is introduced into the synagogues, especially the Amida Prayer, including a benediction against the minim (Christian heretics?). Unlike the time of the destruction of the First Temple, Jews are now more ready to expect the End - Where is God? Was God defeated? Is there a new covenant? People are ready for extreme means and ends.

0080 Gnosticism - Non-rabbinical Jewish sects and early Christian sects of Gnosticism develop, out of the remains of apocalyptic  expectations after the fall of Jerusalem (70 AD), which shatters the hopes of the coming of God's kingdom on earth and leads to a rejection of the world. Within early Christianity, the teachings of Paul and John may have been a starting point for Gnostic ideas, with a growing emphasis on the opposition between flesh and spirit, the value of charisma, and the disqualification of the Jewish law. Tertullian calls Paul "the apostle of the heretics," because Paul's writings were attractive to Gnostics, and interpreted in a Gnostic way, while Jewish Christians felt he strayed from the Jewish roots of Christianity. Paul wrote to the Corinthian church members as "having knowledge." Gnostic ideas find a Jewish variation in the mystical study of Kabbalah.

The Early Church Fathers

Writings of the Apostolic Fathers: First Clement (c. 120 CE)- The Church of Rome intrudes in Corinth; Ignatius' Letters (c. 120 CE) - seven letters regarding his going to Rome to be martyred; Letter(s) of Polycarp to the Philippians (c.125 CE) - against Docetists and Resurrection-deniers; Martyrdom of Polycarp (c. 155 CE) - "Away with the atheists!"

0115 Jewish Rebellion in Egypt and Cyrene, led by (king?) Lucas/Andreas

0130 Papias Bishop of Hieropolis. (c. 70-c. 155 CE) Christian apologists for early gospel dates rely on the slimmest of evidence, including a very late third-hand testimony of a late second-hand testimony that "Mark" had written a narrative, supposedly based on the experiences of Peter as related by the apostle himself. In the fourth century, Church historian Eusebius quotes Papias of Hierapolis as referring to the "presbyter John." Regarding the bishop of Hierapolis, the Catholic Encyclopedia says, "Of Papias's life nothing is known." According to Eusebius—in disagreement with Irenaeus, who suggests Papias had known the apostle John—Papias has no direct acquaintance with any of the

apostles: …Papias himself in the preface to his Exposition of the Sayings of the Lord makes clear that he was never a hearer or eyewitness of the holy apostles, and tells us that he learnt the essentials of the faith from their former pupils. The assumption that the "presbyter John" with whom Papias apparently had a relationship is the apostle John is evidently incorrect. Many of Papias' remarks, according to Eusebius, involve miracles, such as the raising of the dead, which test one’s credulity. Papias is one of the only pieces of evidence Christian apologetics offers as to the dating of the gospels—yet, his testimony concerning these writings of Mark and Matthew is not only second-hand but also too late to possess any value as concerns the earliest of the gospels dates. Moreover, Papias speaks only about a narrative by Mark, which by no means conclusively refers to the canonical Mark as we have it. Nor is the Aramaic gospel of Matthew the same as the canonical Matthew.

0132-0135 Hadrian plans to rebuild Jerusalem as a Hellene city, Aelia Capitolina. Fears of pagan worship on Temple Mount (just as those that preceded the Machabean rebellion) occurring 70 years after the destruction of the Temple (just as the Temple was rebuilt in 516, 70 years after its destruction in 586) inspire Nasi (“king”) Simon Bar Kochba to rise as a military Messiah against the Evil Empire (Rome). A definitive defeat was required before Jews could resign themselves to a “Judaism of the possible.” He is, however, not supported by any rabbis except Akiva, and the revolt fails. Jews are now banned from Jerusalem, and Judea is renamed Syria-Palestina. The Messianic model becomes spiritual rather than military for Jews. The Babylonian rabbinic community takes precedence. What about Jews living outside the Holy Land? Philo of Alexandria is an example of successful adaptation.

The Age of Heresy

0144 Marcionism - Marcion believes Jesus is the savior sent by God, and Paul is his chief apostle, but he rejects the Hebrew Bible and God of the Old Testament as a tyrant or demiurge. Marcionists believe that the God of the Old Testament is a separate and lower entity than the all-forgiving God of the New Testament. This belief is similar to Gnostic theology - both are dualistic, that is, they posit (Manichaean) opposing gods, forces, or principles: one higher, spiritual, and "good," and the other lower, material, and "evil." This dualism stands in contrast to other Christian and Jewish views that "evil" has no independent existence, being merely an absence of "good." Marcion’s canon consists of eleven books: an abridged Gospel of Luke and ten Pauline epistles. The premise of Marcionism is that many of the teachings of Jesus are incompatible with the actions of the Hebrew God.  He further regards the arguments of Paul regarding law and gospel, wrath and grace, works and faith, flesh and spirit, sin and righteousness, death and life, as the essence of religious truth.  Marcionites hold that the God of the Hebrew Bible (known to Gnostics as Yaltabaoth) is inconsistent, jealous, wrathful and genocidal, and that the material world he created is defective, a place of suffering; the God who made such a world is a bungling or malicious <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demiurge">demiurge.</A>  Marcionism shows the influence of <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic">Hellenistic</A>  philosophy on Christianity, by presenting a moral critique of the Old Testament from the standpoint of <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonism">Platonism.</A> According to Harnack, the sect may have led other Christians to introduce a formal statement of beliefs into their liturgy and to formulate a canon of authoritative <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_text">Scripture</A> of their own, thus <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_of_the_New_Testament_canon">eventually producing the current canon of the New Testament.</A>

0150 Justin Martyr (c. 150 CE) As proof of the existence of the gospels prior to the end of the second century, it is claimed that Church father Justin Martyr included 268 "quotations of the New Testament" in his First Apology  (cf. New Evidence that Demands a Verdict by Josh McDowell).

0180 Irenaeus (fl. 180 CE) "Father of the Catholic Canon." The four canonical gospels were not mentioned or named as such by anyone until the time of Church Father Irenaeus, Bishop of Lyons. In Against All Heresies (III, 11.8), Irenaeus is the first to name the canonical gospels and give reasons for their inclusion in the New Testament.

0180 Theophilus (Luke’s Theophilus?), Bishop of Antioch (Luke’s home town), is the first Church father clearly to discuss the canonical gospels.

0200 The Mishna, a rabbinical guidebook, is compiled by Nasi Judah the Patriarch; later, the Talmud (ancient rabbinic writings) is written: one in Babylon (more popular), and one in Jerusalem, as a commentary on the Mishna.

0200 Docetism (Marcionism) - Docetists maintain that Jesus’ human form is an illusion, as testified by the uncanonical Gospel of Peter. This system of beliefs is condemned by Polycarp and Serapion.

0220 Sabellianism - God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit are three different modes or aspects of one monadic God, as perceived by the believer, rather than three distinct persons within the Godhead - that there are no real or substantial differences between the three, such that there is no substantial identity for the Spirit or the Son. At the Arroyo Seco World Wide Camp Meeting, near Los Angeles, in 1913, <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadians">Canadian</A> evangelist <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.E._McAlister">R.E. McAlister</A> states at a baptismal service that the apostles baptized in the name of Jesus only and not in the triune Name of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (Sabellianism is not dead!).

The Real Story of Christmas

“Christmas” is a non-Biblical celebration, that is to say, it is mentioned nowhere in the Bible, was not practiced by the Early Church, and Church Father Origen (c. 184-c. 253 CE) declared it a pagan practice and its celebration a sin.

The date of Jesus’ birth is a matter of speculation, but the four Biblical hints do not favor December 25: first, the Star of Bethlehem, if a juncture of Venus and Jupiter, occurred on June 17, 2 BCE, while that of Jupiter and Saturn occurred in October 7 BCE; second, shepherds tend their flocks “in the field” (Luke 2:8 αγραυλουντες</span><span class="cls_003">)</span></div from May to October, not in December; third, Zacharias’ service as Priest (Luke 1:8-11, 23-24, 26-27)  indicates the birth of John the Baptist in March, and that of Jesus six months later; finally, censuses were forbidden in December, as that was a difficult travel month (Ezra 10:9-13). October might fit, but not December. On the other hand, the Saturnalia, in honor of a Roman agricultural deity, with drunken reveling, gift-giving, and the reversal of roles between slaves and masters, was celebrated each year until around December 23. Also, in 274 CE, Roman Emperor Aurelian declared December 25 to be a festival in honor of “the birth of Sol Invictus,” (winter solstice as the birth of the sun) a Mithraic sun-god cult characterized by handshakes and ritual meals before altars in underground temples.

In 313 CE, in an effort to unite his dissolving Empire, Emperor Constantine issued the Edict of Milan, declaring religious tolerance for Christianity, and later presided over the Council of Nicaea in 325 CE. As masses of Romans now converted to Christianity, they refused to give up their celebratory feasts at the Solstice. A moral debate raged among the clergy, some of whom felt that fallen humankind needed a season of abandonment and excess (from which they could be gradually weaned), as long as it was carried on under the umbrella of Christian supervision, while others argued that all vestiges of paganism must be expunged. The Church compromised by recognizing December 25 as the nativity not of the Sun-god, but of the Son of God. In 742 CE, though, St. Boniface complained to Pope Zacharias that the Franks and Germans, whom he was trying to convince to give up their pagan carnivals, had witnessed such celebrations in the shadow of St. Peter’s itself!

Over subsequent centuries, Christmas absorbed further pagan symbols from Germans (Yule logs), Scandinavians (decorated evergreen trees) and Druids (mistletoe). Reformation Protestants tried reforming Christmas but had little impact. In 1659 English Puritans outlawed Christmas as unchristian, but it proved so popular that it was “restored” in 1681.

More Heresies!

0276 Manichaeism - Manichaeism teaches an elaborate <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dualistic_cosmology">dualistic cosmology</A> describing the <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_between_good_and_evil">struggle</A>  between a <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodness_and_value_theory">good,</A> spiritual world of light; and an <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil">evil,</A> material world of darkness. Through an ongoing process that takes place in human history, light is gradually removed from the world of matter and returned to the world of light, whence it came. Its beliefs are rooted in Zoroastrian dualism preserved in <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnostic">gnostic</A> religious movements. Manichaeism spreads with extraordinary speed both east and west. It reaches Rome through the apostle Psattiq by 280 CE, via <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt">Egypt,</A> where it flourishes in the <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fayum">Fayum</A> area c. 290.

This results in martyrdom for many in Egypt and North Africa. In 354, <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilary_of_Poitiers">Hilary of Poitiers</A> writes that the Manichaean faith is a significant force in southern Gaul. In 381, Christians request that <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodosius_I">Theodosius I</A> strip Manichaeans of their civil rights. He issues a decree of death for Manichaean monks in 382.

0300 Arianism - “Jesus was begotten by and is subordinate to the Father,” a belief held today by Jehovah’s Witnesses.

0325 The First Council of Nicaea is summoned to resolve a disagreements arising from within the  <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Alexandria">Church of Alexandria</A> over Arianism:  whether the Son was 'begotten' by the Father from his own being, and therefore had no beginning, or else was created out of nothing, and therefore had a beginning. This hyper-intellectualization of Christianity allows total control over the message, and of course the loser of the debate, Arius, is banished.

0350 Donatism - Elements of the Church attack apostate clergy who had collaborated with the Roman persecutors as unworthy to administer sacraments. <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo">Augustine of Hippo</A> campaigns against Donatism as bishop, and through his efforts, orthodoxy gains the upper hand. According to Augustine, sacramental validity is a property of the priesthood independent of the individual character of the priest. Influenced by the <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Testament">Old Testament,</A> he believes in discipline as a means of education. In his letter to Vincentius, Augustine uses the <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament">New Testament Parable of the Great Banquet</A> to justify using force against the Donatists: "You are of the opinion that no one should be compelled to follow righteousness; and yet you read that the householder said to his servants, 'Whomsoever ye shall find, compel them to come in.'" The Church thereafter conveniently uses Augustine's texts to justify the use of force in the <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_pagans_in_the_late_Roman_Empire">persecution of pagan religions,</A> of heretics by the <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquisition">Inquisition,</A> and of Native American  <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_American_religion">religions.</A>

 <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Christ">Christ,</A> he had only a single "nature" which was divine.

Monophysitism is born in the theological <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_of_Alexandria">"School</A>   <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_of_Alexandria">of Alexandria,</A>" which begins its Christological analysis with the (divine) eternal Son or Word of God and seeks to explain how this eternal Word became incarnate as a man — in contrast to the <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_of_Antioch">"School of Antioch</A>" (birthplace of  <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestorianism">Nestorianism,</A> the antithesis of Monophysitism), which instead begins with the (human) Jesus of the Gospels and seeks to explain how this man became united with the eternal Word in the Incarnation. Accepted by the Sees of Rome, Constantinople, and Antioch, the Chalcedonian settlement (451CE) encounters strong resistance in Alexandria (and in Egypt generally), leading ultimately to the schism between the Oriental Orthodox churches (which reject Chalcedon) on the one hand, and the so-called <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalcedonian">Chalcedonian</A>  churches on the other. There are two major doctrines that can indisputably be called

Into the Middle Ages

0754 The Donation of Constantine - In 751 Aistulf, king of the Lombards (a Scandinavian horde), conquers what remains of the Byzantine Empire in northern Italy and demands the submission of Pope Stephen II in Rome. In France, Pepin the Short, Mayor of the Palace of Neustria and Austrasia and a Roman Catholic, deposes the last Merovingian king and claims the throne as King of the Franks, yet lacks consensus for his rule. Stephen is in desperate need of an ally against the Lombards and so approaches Pepin with the promise of monarchical legitimacy in return for his support. The Donation of Constantine, by which the Emperor Constantine in 315 (or 317) gave to Pope Sylvester I the right to temporal rule over Western Europe, is likely forged for the occasion. Stephen, by the authority vested in the Donation, anoints Pepin King of the Franks in a ceremony recalled in French coronation rites down to 1792. Pepin returns the favor by granting Stephen the Lombard territories he takes in northern and central Italy (the Rome-Ravenna Corridor that becomes the Papal States). In 778, Pope Hadrian refers to the Donation in requesting further land-grants from Charlemagne. The forgery is exposed by Latinist scholar Lorenzo Valla in 1440, though doubts as to its authenticity had been voiced by Emperor Otto III as early as 1001.

Where’s Waldo?

1173 Waldensians - Wealthy merchant <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Waldo">Peter Waldo</A> gives away his property and preaches <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostolic_poverty">apostolic</A>   <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostolic_poverty">poverty</A> as the way to <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfection">perfection.</A> He teaches that: temporal offices and dignities are not meant for preachers of the Gospel; that saints’ relics are simply rotten bones which belonged to one knew not whom; that to go on pilgrimage serves no end, save to empty one's purse; that meat might be eaten any day; that holy water is no more efficacious than rain water; and that prayer in a barn is just as effectual as that offered in a church.

Waldensians are accused of having scoffed at the doctrine of <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transubstantiation">transubstantiation,</A> and of having spoken blasphemously of the Catholic Church as the <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whore_of_Babylon">harlot of the Apocalypse.</A> They reject what they perceive as the idolatry of the Catholic Church and consider the Pope the Antichrist of Rome. They believe in such issues as the universal priesthood, preaching the gospel in the vulgar tongue, and taking up voluntary poverty. The Catholic Church views the Waldensians as heretical, and in 1184 at the <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synod_of_Verona">Synod</A>   <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synod_of_Verona">of Verona,</A> under the auspices of <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Lucius_III">Pope Lucius III,</A> they are excommunicated. Pope Innocent III goes even further during the <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Lateran_Council">Fourth Lateran Council</A> in 1215, officially denouncing the Waldensians as  <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heresy">heretics.</A> In 1211 more than 80 Waldensians are burned as heretics at <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strasbourg">Strasbourg,</A> launching several centuries of <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Inquisition">persecution</A> that nearly destroy the movement. The group is nearly annihilated in the seventeenth century and is confronted with organized and generalized discrimination in the centuries that followed.

St Augustine taught that error has no rights. He cited biblical texts to justify the use of compulsion, notably Luke 14:16-23. Had not Christ himself blinded St Paul in order to make him see the true light? According to Augustine, coercion using “great violence” was justified. He made a distinction between unbelievers, who persecuted because of cruelty, and Christians, who persecuted because of love. A war to preserve or restore the unity of the Church was a just war, a bellum Deo auctore, a war waged by God himself.

Inquisitions

are  institutions of the Catholic Church established to combat heresy, started in 1184 in France to root out Cathars and Waldensians in Southern France. In the papal bull Ad Extirpanda of 1252, Pope Innocent IV explicitly authorizes the use of torture to elicit confessions from suspected heretics. Inquisitions were largely abolished after the Napoleonic Wars in Europe, but the office still exists in the Catholic Church, though now called the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith. Most sentences seem to have consisted of penances like wearing a cross sewn on one's clothes, going on pilgrimage, etc., though unrepentant heresy was often punished by burning at the stake.

Spanish Inquisition Inquisitions occur in all lands and colonies where the Catholic Church has authority (except England and Castille), of which the most notorious is the Spanish Inquisition. The Iberian Peninsula in 1492 consists of territories recently reconquered from the Muslims and still retains strong Muslim and Jewish influence.  Muslims and Jews are given the choice of leaving, converting, or dying. Many stay and convert, though the Christian authorities doubt that all these conversos will suddenly become and remain orthodox Roman Catholics. So this Inquisition has a special socio-political basis as well as fundamental religious motives. The last execution of the Spanish Inquisition occurs in 1826 when Cayetano Ripoll is garroted for teaching Deism.

Roman Inquisition After the Protestant Reformation explodes onto the scene, Catholic authorities become suspicious of the vary Renaissance humanism that they earlier encouraged. In 1542 Pope Paul III establishes the Roman Inquisition to examine and proscribe errors and false doctrines. The most famous case it tries is that of Galileo Galilei in 1633, for claiming that the sun is the center of the solar system. Galileo is found “vehemently suspect of heresy,” is threatened with torture if he does not recant his teachings; he recants, and is kept under house arrest until his death in 1642

Witches

The medieval church initially condemns belief in witches as a pagan superstition, but folk beliefs refuse to die. Local folk practice often mix chants, incantations, and prayers to the saints to ward off storms, protect cattle, or ensure a good harvest. Bonfires on Midsummer's Eve are intended to deflect natural catastrophes or the influence of fairies, ghosts, and witches. The punishment for evil witchcraft is death, but there are few prosecutions because of the Law of Talion, which stipulates that if the accused witch is not found guilty, the accuser will pay the penalty of death. The difficulty of proving witchcraft is sufficient to discourage frivolous accusations. In the 1230’s, however, Inquisitors, who accuse on behalf of the Church rather than an individual and are thus free of the restrictions of the Law of Talion, link heresy to magic. Before 1252, there is only about one prosecution per year. Then Inquisitors, authorized by Pope Innocent IV, begin to use torture to interrogate heretic magicians. When a suspected witch is reported to the Inquisitors, the individual is interrogated. If no confession is forthcoming, torture is employed, and the accused starts to confess to almost anything, and to accuse other “members” of their “sabbat” (coven).

From 1375 -1435 there is a marked increase in prosecutions, and treatises on witchcraft begin to appear, possibly in answer to the upheavals of the era - the Black Death (1347), the Hundred Years' War (1337-1453), the Little Ice Age (~1500-1700), and the Protestant Reformation (1517) - and these folk superstitions percolate up into Church leadership. Still, as late as 1484, local German church officials are reluctant to participate in the Inquisition, and one even expels Dominican priest Heinrich Kramer from his diocese in Innsbruck for making false accusations. In his influential book Malleus Maleficarum, published in 1487,Kramer expresses his beliefs that witchcraft is responsible for bad weather and that women are inherently susceptible to Satanic seduction because of their raging libido.

1500-1700 is the Golden Age for witch trials. By 1500 the concept of witches is well defined and widely

accepted, being written about by recognized intellectual authorities of the age (including English king James I). Any misfortune which occurs, such a barn burning down, or the death of a child, or childlessness itself, can be ascribed to dark magic, and anyone who has a grudge against the victim of the misfortune is under suspicion. As always, the most vulnerable are most suspect, and the most vulnerable tend to be older women dependent upon the charity of others, most likely because of the death of a husband. If one spurns the advances of a beggar and returns home to find ones barn burnt down, the connection is clear. The fact that many of these women are emotionally fragile and sometimes confess merely for the attention only reinforces the community’s fears. Women are considered to be intellectually and morally inferior, and on that account bitter. Witches are also

associated with a hunger for the flesh of infants, having animal familiars who aid in their fiendish plans, a special mark of their bodies that signifies their pact with Satan, and membership in a “synagogue” or “sabbat” of witches who participate in sexual orgies with demonic spirits.

The last witch executed in Europe is Anna Goeldin, decapitated on 13 June 1782 in Zurich after she confesses, under torture, to a pact with Satan. Her execution is described in the press as judicial

1431 Joan of Arc, born a peasant at Domremy in

northeast France, is considered a heroine of France for her role during the Hundred Years’ War. Joan claims to have received visions of the Archangel Michael, Saint Margaret, and Saint Catherine of Alexandria instructing her to recover France from English domination. The unanointed King Charles VII reluctantly sends Joan to the Siege of Orleans as part of a relief army. She gains prominence when the siege is lifted only nine days later. Several additional swift victories lead to Charles VII's consecration at Rheims. This paves the way for the final French victory.

On 23 May 1430, she is captured Burgundians. She

is sold to the English after Charles VII refuses to ransom her, put on trial by the Inquisitor of North France Jean Lemaitre for witchcraft because she wore male clothing, and burnt at the stake at about nineteen years of age.

Her attribution of Divine Guidance annoys

Church leaders, but she is finally canonized in 1920, though as late as 1902, Papal Consistors cite her capture as proof that her claims that she was sent by God are false, and refuse to place her in the Calendar of Saints.

Martin Luther

1517 Luther publishes his 95 Theses - and formulates a creed whereby humans are considered to be deeply

corrupt, powerless to save themselves, and justified only through god's grace. The individual relates directly to god (without the intercession of a Church); that church is a place for sermons, not sacraments; and that only the Bible has authority (not the writings of Church Fathers). Protestant reformers Martin Luther and John Calvin agree with the post-Pelagian Augustine that Original Sin completely destroys liberty <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_depravity">(total depravity</A>), thereby presuming a lack of free will.

Luther was, unfortunately, also a vicious anti-

Semite. In On the Jews and their Lies he asks: "What shall we Christians do with this rejected and condemned people, the Jews":

"First, to set fire to their synagogues or schools …

so that God might see that we are Christians …

Second, I advise that their houses also be razed. Third, I advise that all their prayer books and

Talmudic writings …be taken from them.

Fourth, I advise that their rabbis be forbidden to teach henceforth on pain of loss of life and limb … Fifth, I advise that safe-conduct on the highways be abolished completely for the Jews… Sixth, I advise that … all cash and treasure of silver and gold be taken from them … Seventh, I recommend putting a flail, an ax, a hoe, a spade, a distaff, or a spindle into the hands of young,

strong Jews and Jewesses and letting them earn their bread in the sweat of their brow … But if we are afraid that they might harm us, … then let us eject them forever from the country …"

A little further on, he writes "we are at fault in not slaying them." As a result of Luther’s influence, his Prince, John Frederick I, Elector of Saxony, in 1543 revoked

concessions granted to his Jewish community; John of Brandenburg-Küstrin repealed the safe conduct of Jews in his territories; Luther's followers sacked the synagogue of Berlin in 1572 and in the following years the Jews were driven out of Brandenburg and several other German Lutheran states.

Shortly after the Kristallnacht, Martin Sasse, Bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Thuringia,

published a compendium of Luther’s writings; Sasse: "On November 10, 1938, on Luther's birthday, the synagogues are burning in Germany."

The city of Nuremberg presented a first edition of

On the Jews and their Lies to Julius Streicher, editor of the Nazi newspaper Der Stürmer, on his birthday in 1937. It was publicly exhibited in a glass case at the Nuremberg rallies. On December 17, 1941, seven Lutheran regional church confederations issued a statement agreeing with the policy of forcing Jews to wear the yellow badge, "since after his bitter experience Luther had strongly suggested preventive measures against the Jews and their expulsion from German territory."

1545 Council of Trent

The Catholic Church responds to the Protestant surge in Northern Europe with reform and religious wars. Jesuits open universities teaching Scholasticism infused with Renaissance humanism.

1630 Herbert of Cherbury contrasts revealed/positive religion to natural religion. Natural religion is universal, rational, and compatible with nature. Organized religion is by its nature corrupt.

1640~ Descartes asserts "natural reason," as the highest intellectual authority: ”cogito ergo sum.” 1666 Philipp Spener - The Pietists argue for spiritual and moral regeneration to overcome the sterility and abstractness of the Enlightenment, and maintain that god can be experienced directly. They criticize Kant as too universal, and lacking a personal experience of god. They seek a religion of the heart - ‘How do I know I'm saved?” “Accept Jesus as your personal savior.” The Great Awakening has arrived.

Caravaggio - The Pietist Schoolman

1687 Newton proves much previous Aristotelian ‘science’ wrong, thereby diminishing the role of God in the universe; the scientific revolution has begun.

Skepticism

1690 Locke - The first fruits of the Enlightenment: universal human reason, freedom from religious authority, superstition, even religion itself. Locke proposes a "reasonable" christianity, a "natural religion" based in reason, though accepting intuitive, self-evident principles.

1739 Hume is an Empiricist (knowledge is founded on sense perception), and a critic of religion, who questions whether one’s senses can confirm natural religion. He shows the limits of knowledge: argument from design is faulty because its cause (God) is not proportional to the observed effect (the world). Religion has its origin in human psychology, especially in fear and desire for power.

1767 Voltaire proposes Deism (belief in a non-interventionist supreme being), and gives a scathing critique of traditional Christianity. Opponents claim that without God, morality would collapse.

1770 Diderot, an atheist materialist: ‘Religious explanations cannot be rationally defended.’ 1774 Unitarianism is a movement named for its belief that the God is one person, as opposed to a Trinity. Unitarians believe that Jesus was inspired in his moral teachings, and he is a savior, but he was not himself a god. Unitarianism also rejects the doctrines of original sin, predestination, Biblical inerrancy, and punishment in an eternal hell.

1774 Romanticism: In reaction to the implications of the Enlightenment, Romantics emphasize one’s spontaneous, emotional, creative side; the artistic-contemplative connection to nature; a mystical union with the divine that produces works of art beyond the reach of reason.

1780 Thomas Jefferson considers the teachings of Jesus as having "the most sublime and benevolent code of morals which has ever been offered to man," yet he holds that the pure teachings of Jesus appear to have been appropriated by some of Jesus' early followers, resulting in a Bible that contains both "diamonds" of wisdom and the "dung" of ancient political agenda. Jefferson used certain passages of the New Testament to compose <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Bible">The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth</A> (the "Jefferson Bible"), which stressed his moral message without any <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle">miracles</A> or reference to his divinity.

1781 Kant generates his "critical philosophy" -

To act morally is to act autonomously, but our desire for happiness works subconsciously as we are seduced by "radical evil," which always subverts our moral action, so virtue

1807 Hegel

“History is the process whereby the Absolute Spirit empties itself into creation, and humans evolve

from self-consciousness to god-consciousness.” He feels Kant is unable to reconcile the subjective and objective and Romantic emphasis on feeling and emotion. Kant is static, yet reality evolves. His inability to know the "thing in itself" is a mere stage in the growth of consciousness. Hegel is an idealist (reality consists of ideas), so while Kant's idealism is subjective, Hegel’s is absolute - we can know through our rational faculties. Spirit begins as undifferentiated, then successively differentiates until through dialectic achieving the reconciliation of Spirit. Religion is a social phenomenon to show people who they are; Protestantism makes priests of all believers, so that the divine is found not in church but in the state, and religion is eventually superseded by philosophy.

1810 Schleiermacher - Piety gives us experience of reality and our absolute dependence on god. Religion is a separate irreducible sphere of life; it is the sense and taste for the infinite, feeling part of the universe, in which we lose our sense of oneness and become one with the universe.

1835 David Strauss’ book The Life of Jesus posits that in Scripture people wrote a mythical rather historical text - true as myth, not as history. The gospels are true, even if they didn’t happen; they are parables meant to communicate a religious truth, just as Parson Weems invented the story of George Washington and the cherry tree.

1840 Emerson stresses defying convention and looking within for the unique insight (the Quaker Inner Light) granted to each individual, that no one else can find for one. "As men's prayers are a disease of the will, so are their creeds a disease of the intellect" (Self-Reliance, 1841).

Kierkegaard

1841 Ludwig Feuerbach: “Religion prevents one from grappling with the reality of life.” God is a creation of the human imagination; we attribute to God crucial aspects of our own humanity, alienating ourselves from our true essence, masking and exacerbating fundamental forces of alienation and suffering; we must overcome belief in God and recover our own essence. Reality is ultimately material; Hegel's highest realities (self-consciousness, reason, and spirit) are aspects of humanity alienated by religion. We must renounce a god that requires exclusive faith commitments that separate us from other human beings, to come to a sense of ourselves again.

1843 Kierkegaard:  Abraham's killing of Isaac is a teleological suspension of the ethical by the spiritual, like

that of Iphigenia, a murder of innocence for the greater good. His Night of Infinite Resignation stresses giving up this world in favor of the next (pandering to the hope of immortality). He posits faith by virtue of the Absurd - a leap of faith, but not blind faith - a human heart risking all, without justification, trusting in God's love. He attacks modern efforts to make Christianity reasonable; faith is only realized in passionate commitment. Faith is the struggle of a lifetime, an encounter with the creative source of life. Abraham's sacrifice of Isaac is murder, an act of faith, an act of infinite resignation, which views things of this world as unimportant compared with things eternal. Abraham has faith through the Absurd idea that he will get Isaac back. Kierkegaard's paradox: God's is transcendent; faith itself is a gift from god, that reason cannot grasp, so reason resents it, and because of sin cannot accept it.

An encounter with Jesus the teacher grants us the condition of acceptance and salvation. Religious truth comes to us from outside; salvation is not available except through Jesus. As sinners, we don't want to see it; our reason is offended, but God is absolutely different, while reason wants to domesticate God. Reason must recognize and accept its limits and surrender to the paradox. [Yet faith is likewise bound up with pride, and refuses to recognize a law outside itself - reason. Also, as long as we’re surrendering to paradoxes, how do we know which one? Doesn’t Islam or any cult leader make exactly the same claim that since reason can't arrive at their predetermined conclusion, we must abandon reason and “take the leap of faith and trust that God will catch you”? Of course, our “God-given” reason recoils at anything so monstrous as murdering one’s own child.]

1844 The YMCA is founded in London to put Christian principles into practice by developing a healthy "body, mind, and spirit."

John Henry Newman and Marx

1845 John Henry Newman defends the authority of the church. One can know God only through self- denial and obedience, to which the Church is an indispensable guide. World history is moved by divine activity in a continuing revelation. Catholics must trust that the church is infallible.

1847 Horace Bushnell: Doctrines of sin and salvation cannot be dismissed; one must read the bible as inspiration and a poetic form of life, as different branches pointing at the same truth; doctrines evolve.

1848 Marx Religion is a false consciousness by which people delude themselves to cope with oppression; it is a psychological and social, rather than divine, phenomenon. Feuerbach's reversal of Hegel is an important step, but Feuerbach is mistaken in his view that the power of thought can change human life; Marx has an entirely materialistic interpretation: human emancipation will occur when we overcome the split between citizenship and civil society. The Communist Manifesto is issued in 1848, as anti- monarchical revolutions rock Europe, proclaiming the need for a proletarian revolution from below. The movement of history is not a matter of thought, but of human productive activity. Philosophers interpret the world; the point is to change it. Feuerbach thought of religion as a form of illness, splitting us in two; for Marx, religion is only a symptom - the sickness is inequality and oppression; religion is a palliative, the opium of the people, to make us forget how miserable we are, a false consciousness shaped by forces that it hides from itself. We must look below the surface to social material biological dynamics.

1852 Ritschl is a spokesman for liberal Protestants and modernist Catholics: there is no conflict between modernism and religion; doctrines are mere poetic expressions of religious experience. Ritschl, a Kantian considers Jesus the embodiment of ethical calling; divine grace is a spiritual freedom that makes moral action possible in the context of Christian tradition. Jesus’ ethical work justifies the Christian community. Salvation can come only through Jesus; Protestantism is the consummation of God's plan.

1865 The Salvation Army is founded to bring salvation to the poor, destitute, and hungry by meeting both their "physical and spiritual needs,” running charity shops, and operating shelters for the homeless.

1869 Modern “Christianity”: In order to appeal to a broader spectrum, and especially vibrant masculinity, religions compromise core values - "turning the other cheek" is replaced by a muscular embrace of military expansionism; serving the poor is replaced by "Acres of Diamonds."

1869 Ultramontanists - Catholic Anti-modernists give greater authority to the Pope. In 1854 Pius IX declares the teaching of the Immaculate Conception without consulting bishops; in 1864 he publishes The Syllabus of Errors condemning secularization and political liberalism; in 1869 the First Vatican Council declares him infallible based on Mt 16:18. In 1870, in answer to threats from secularization, Aquinas is declared to be the foundation of dogma.

1870 Bruno Bauer: Jews will be emancipated only when religion is abolished; the state offers us freedom in the abstract: Paul says there are neither slave nor free, neither male nor female, yet he supported slavery and subordination of women; the state makes us equal as citizens, yet allows deep inequalities; consciousness mystifies and ritualizes the social origins of alienation and domination.

Liberal Protestant and Nietzsche

1875 Liberal Protestants - roots in Unitarian revolt against orthodox Calvinism - come into mainstream

of US Protestantism; adapt religious ideas to modern culture (reconcile Christianity w/science); reject biblical literalism; stress ethical teachings of the Bible; ally w/“social gospel;” and urban revivalists; optimistic trust in community, focus on salvation and personal growth; accept evolution through “natural selection,” rejecting the “dogma of special creations.”

1879 Christian Scientists are founded by Mary Baker Eddy for those who believe faith can heal any illness. 1882 Nietzsche “God is dead!” True World theologies are debunked. True World theology (the idea

that paradise exists, but not here) is of three types: Temporal (this world is the only reality, but is being guided and will be transformed in the future, yielding philosophies of history, like that of Marx), Monistic (individuals are identical to the universe, as in the Upanishads and transcendentalism and Zen), and Eternal (beside this earthly reality is a parallel Christian/Muslim/Buddhist heaven/hell).

For those who have cast off these psychological crutches, life is suddenly unhinged and seems meaningless. Mere material prosperity cannot solve the dilemma of meaning in life. People need the True World theories to protect them from the harsh realities of this world. Without them they sink into nihilism. According to Nietzsche, the conclusion that life is meaningless is mistaken: nihilism must be transcended. There are two types of nihilists: Passive Nihilists, for whom the rejection of the myth of an afterlife shatters their sense of order in the universe. Disoriented and searching for some meaning beyond narrow self-interest, they are often sucked into mass political movements. Active Nihilists, however, having realized the death of God, search within themselves for their unique meaning to life (their Will to Power); they “become who they are,” embrace adversity, and say “Yes!” to life. The first step is to overcome the fear of non-conformity

(like Emerson’s dictum, “Society punishes non-conformity.”) and laziness. A person requires an organizing idea. The specifics are not important, but one must look within to find one’s passion, one’s unique goal, one’s Will to Power. Adversity, far from being a cause for despair, is the very stuff of growth and life. Lasting happiness arises not through material wealth, or through following a religious phantasm, but only through struggle to achieve one’s self-appointed goal.

1883 Wellhausen develops the documentary hypothesis, a historical-critical method whereby the Bible is shown to be a text written and often edited by humans at various times.

1900 20th century New Atheists criticize the violence, irrationality, and intolerance of religion. 1902 Capitalist Christianity: "Coal mining is a business, not a religious, sentimental, or academic proposition. The rights and interests of the laboring man will be protected and cared for not by the labor agitators, but by the Christian men, to whom God in His infinite wisdom has given control of the property interests of the country." George F. Baer, President Philadelphia and Redding Coal and Iron Co.

Fundamentalism - Knees jerk, heads find the sand

1859 Darwin's Origin of the Species claims the world is far older than the Bible allows, and rejects history guided by God; natural selection contradicts the Bible claim that God created each species.

1874 What is Darwinism Charles Hodge attacks evolution as atheistic; he and others form the core of Princeton Theology, a fundamentalist doctrine;

1910-1915 AC Dixon The Fundamentals expresses opposition to modernism and higher criticism (the

documentary hypothesis), and tries to make biblical theology an empiricist philosophy.

In Fundamentalism, three streams converge: those of Evangelicalism (Great Awakening), Dispensationalism (apocalypticism), and Princeton Theology (Biblical inerrancy), to assert five fundamental beliefs: 1) inerrancy of the Bible, 2) the <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_literalism">literal nature of the biblical accounts,</A>

especially regarding Christ's miracles and the  <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis_creation_narrative">Creation account in Genesis,</A>

3) the virgin birth of Christ, 4) the bodily resurrection and physical return

of Christ, and

5) the <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitutionary_atonement">substitutionary atonement</A> of Christ on

the cross.

In socio-political terms, fundamentalism reflects dismay over: the loss of the old religion-based Anglo- Saxon order; the movement from an agrarian to an urban society; immigration by non-white, non- Protestants; higher criticism poking holes in the Bible; the collapse of western values during World War I; the rise of unions; the rise of women; the rise of minorities; and the spread of secondary schools exposing children to secular ideas and religious doubt.

1915 Anger and dismay at modernism is channeled into the reborn political wing of the Fundamentalist movement, the Ku Klux Klan.

1916 Karl Barth’s Epistle to the Romans: The brutality of World War I causes a loss of confidence in modernism, and emphasizes God's transcendence. Barth agrees with Feuerbach that religion is ‘people talking about people.’ Barth prefers revelation - confession, acknowledgement of god's saving message. Much influenced by K, Barth asserts that God cannot be known, that religion is ultimately disbelief, that religion never gets beyond man to God, that religion is justification of ourselves, that theology is anthropology, that one should be suspicious of religion, that we should allow God to reach us through revelation, taken on faith. But trying to defend this confession is to acknowledge that humans can judge and explain God (uh-oh); one must read the Bible as the witness of God's revelation. On the left, he rejects Schleiermacher’s transcendence; and on the right, he rejects biblical inerrancy and total depravity. The bases of faith, however, he considers a priori.

1919 Prohibition passes, a predominantly Fundamentalist cause.

What it’s all about?

1920 Freud: Religion is an illusion that helps us repress fundamental conflicts at the heart of our psychic life, the expression of our repressed desires in coded ways, originating in an Oedipal complex, with simultaneous love and hate for the Father. God is a form of wish fulfillment, a Father to whom we can express our love and who will forgive us for our hate; that is, our sin. Religion is a false consciousness hiding conflict between amoral pleasure and reality; it is a negotiation between the id and ego; it is a mass neurosis. Consciousness is shaped by repression of desire; civilization is built on coercion and renunciation. Religion is an effect of repression and the inability of humans to confront unavoidable psychic conflict.

1923 The New Geology by Fundamentalist George McCready Price: the creation of the Earth occurred on a Tuesday in 4004 BCE.

1925The Butler Act bans teaching evolution; hence the Scopes Trial, during which William Jennings Bryan attacks the “oligarchy of scientists.” Bryan is humiliated on the stand and dies a week later.

1920’s School textbook publishers self-censor controversial science to suit Fundamentalism.

1928 Southern and Midwestern Democrats’ reject Al Smith for being wet, Catholic New Yorker.

1945 Dietrich Bonhoeffer, an advocate of “religionless christianity,” is executed by the Nazis. In the growing secularization after the death of God, religion ceases to play a significant role, with increasing separation of church and state, decreasing numbers of worshippers, and the individualization of religion.

1947 Carl Henry The Uneasy Conscience of the Modern Fundamentalist: reasserts biblical infallibility: God's revelations are the source of all truth, moral absolutes; all human thought must begin with presuppositions that cannot be proven but can be rationally defended.

1951 Paul Tillich Reactions to Barth: Barth overlooks the inherent linkage between humans and God: people are threatened by meaninglessness.

1953 Ludwig Wittgenstein, a traditionalist, posits that trust and community ground all forms of life, though he has suspicion of particular beliefs and practices rather than religion in general. He asserts conservative politics and fundamentalist religion as the right path.

1957 Sputnik alarms the US out of its narcotizing religiosity and denial of science. 1961 Flood Geology asserts that Noah’s flood caused geological layers. 1962 Engel v Vitale bans school prayer. 1963 Faced with the possible Soviet supremacy in space, the US updates its education with modern science textbooks.

The Religion of Politics or Politics of Religion

1967 Liberation theology brings out the political relevance of theology and rejects generalism; the church is not a fortress, but part of the city. The church is too closely associated with local elites; religion is used as an opiate for the poor. James Cone in A Black Theology of Liberation stresses the links between political and social liberation and God's work on the one hand, and complicity of the churches in oppressive sexism, racism, economic exploitation, wide gap between rich and poor, and Marxist views of the influence of material conditions upon consciousness on the other. Critics of this view cite a conflation of political liberation and Christian salvation. Mary Daly: Liberation theology is a response to poverty, the evils of colonialism, and the failure of the first world to spark development.

Oscar Romero: Christian faith ought not to isolate us from, but rather immerse us in the world.

1970 Hal Lindsay’s The Late, Great Planet Earth suggests 1988 as the time of the Rapture.

1973 Roe v Wade legalizes abortion. 1974 Paul Ricoeur sees Barth's suspicion of religion's false comforts deepening the language of faith. He seeks suspicion to destroys idols and create space to hear the word of God.

1983 Rowan Williams: We need to recover elements of pre-modern traditions; ethics cannot be based in human reason; revelation, not reason is the shaping force in life. On Christian Theology acknowledges suspicion as a spiritual exercise: if we start from the human, we can't arrive at God; revelation allows us to break out of the liberal/fundamentalist dichotomy.

1968 Butler Act is ruled unconstitutional; Fundamentalists demand “Equal Time” to teach Creationism. 1980 Ronald Reagan champions Fundamentalism with the slogan, “Let’s Make America Great Again!” 1987 The Supreme Court determines that Creation Science is religious, strikes down Equal Time; the Fundamentalists now promote Intelligent Design.

1988 88 Reasons why the Rapture will occur in 1988 by Edgar Whisenant. He is wrong 1991 Gianni Vattimo : Secularization is a purification of religion, a trait of authentic religious experience. 1991 Stephen Carter The Culture of Disbelief: Religions are mutually exclusive: extra ecclesia nulla salus; The ideas of “God's chosen people” breeds intolerance. How can we function in a religiously diverse society? Secularism - people from all faiths or no faith engage on a level playing field. Strong secularism holds that public discourse should be free of religious language, but in that case, religion might be trivialized - the price of the compromise reached by the Founding Fathers. The US has had for the past 50 years a legal secularism in which the public sphere is strictly secular and religion deemed irrelevant to civil obligations.

1992 Daniel Dennett Breaking the Spell: We ought to study religion like any other mystical human phenomenon, remaining critical of those who believe in belief rather than God.

2000 Plantinga: Belief can be rationally justified without evidence if this belief serves as a properly basic belief.

The End of Faith:

2004 Sam Harris asserts that religion is irrational,  causes violence, and refuses to acknowledge the truth of other religions. Harris is critical of the <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_right">Christian right</A> in politics in the United States, blaming them for the political focus on "pseudo-problems like gay marriage." He is also critical of <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Christianity">liberal</A>   <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Christianity">Christianity</A>—as represented, for instance, by the theology of <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Tillich">Paul Tillich</A>—which he argues claims to base its beliefs on the Bible despite actually being influenced by secular modernity. He further states that in so doing liberal Christianity provides rhetorical cover to fundamentalists. He proposes spirituality without religion.

2010 Jeffrey Stout Democracy and Tradition supports a weaker form of secularism that he terms “secularization” whereby religious people need not relinquish their beliefs; people with different backgrounds can come together in constructive interaction.

2016 Fundamentalists overwhelmingly support Donald Trump for President, not for his character or personal beliefs, but because they feel he will put them back in charge of the culture. David Brody, the host of “Faith Nation” on the Christian Broadcasting Network: “Does Mr. Trump have moral failings? Yes. Critics will suggest a hypocrisy coming from evangelical leaders who are quick to denounce the ethical failings of others who don’t have an “R” next to their name. But the goal of evangelicals has always been winning the larger battle over control of the culture, not to get mired in the moral failings of each and every candidate. For evangelicals, voting in the macro is the moral thing to do, even if the candidate is morally flawed. Evangelicals have tried the “moral” candidate before.”

The Historical vs. the Mythical Jesus - Authentication

So what most likely really happened two

thousand years ago? There are numerous stories about Jesus, some more credible than others. Those events which more likely occurred must be carefully sifted out from the miraculous mythology invented by his followers inspired by the “Holy Spirit.”  The sources within 100 years of Jesus’ death from which all the information we have on Jesus are as follows:

The non-Christian documentation of Jesus’ life is very slim: only two short Roman references: Pliny the Younger (112 CE) - Ltr #10 to Trajan: “Christians are a pestiferous group who worship Jesus as a god; how should I deal with them?” Tacitus Annals (115 CE) - “The burning of Rome in 64 CE is blamed on Christians, who are the hatred of the human race, followers of Jesus, who was crucified by Pilate.”

and one contemporary Jewish source: Philo (20 BCE-50 CE) - never mentions Jesus. Flavius Josephus (37-100 CE) mentions Jesus, with possible emendation by later Christian scribes - 18:3:3 “Jesus a doer of wonders, the Messiah, rose from the dead.”

In Scripture, Jesus is mentioned in Paul, Acts, non-canonical sources, and the Gospels: Paul, who never met Jesus and seems not to have been familiar with his teachings, appears to know only the following about Jesus: he was born of a woman (Gal 4:4), Jewish (Gal 4:4), had brothers (1 Cor 9:5), one of whom was named James (Gal 1), ministered principally to Jews (Rom 15:8), was betrayed (1 Cor 11), held the Last Supper (1Cor 11), and was crucified. Of Jesus’ teachings Paul records only that Christians should not get divorced and ought to pay preachers, but Paul never cites Jesus’ teachings in defense of doctrine. Acts mentions him only in 1:1-8, where Jesus appears, commands the apostles to stay in Jerusalem, evades a question on restoring the kingdom of Israel, then disappears into a cloud. Non-canonical Scriptural sources of stories about Jesus abound, such as the Gospels of Thomas, Peter, and numerous others. These are useful, however, only in reflecting what the early Christian community might have thought about Jesus. They have little authenticity regarding Jesus’ actual life. So we must rely largely upon the Gospels and try to distinguish the Historical Jesus from the Mythological Jesus. Unfortunately, the canonical books of the New Testament have been tampered with, from the addition of nine verses to the gospel of Mark, to John’s manipulation of the day of crucifixion to coincide with the killing of the lambs, to the doctored text forced on Erasmus to document the teaching of the Trinity, to fraudulent Epistles of Paul and the Deutero-Pauline Epistles, to the “gospels” of Peter, Thomas, Judas, Mary, and a legion of others. Though the motivations of these forgeries and creative manipulations of fact were most probably pious, they only cloud the facts of the life of Jesus.

Criteria for Distinguishing Genuine Details from the Life of Jesus

Fortunately, there are criteria available to try to cull the factual from the fantastic. Many of the stories attributed to Jesus are inconsistent, illogical, and unsubstantiated. So how can we know what really happened? To the usual standards of

Multiple Attestation: Being noted in more than one independent source (confers increasing plausibility), Dissimilarity:  When an entry is unlikely to have been added by zealous Christian wishing to embellish the image of Jesus (this too lends increased plausibility), and

Contextual credibility: Whether actions or words fit 1st</span><span class="cls_003"> century Palestine (lack of such credibility</span></div decreases plausibility),

I would add miracles/dreams/angels (decreasing plausibility) prophetic fulfillment (decreasing plausibility), and lack of witness except the “Holy Spirit” (decreasing plausibility). These last three criteria are my own, for which I offer the following rationale:

Miracles/dreams/angels: No, Virginia, there is no Santa Claus. The understandable tendency of people

to perpetuate myth must be let go of to find the truth of Jesus’ life. Miracles, that is, physical impossibilities, do not occur in this universe. There are phenomena (events in the cursus communis naturae) that we don’t yet understand, so perhaps Jesus knew some secret way to turn water into wine, but it is highly improbable. “Magic” is a skill that one can learn from Penn and Teller or David

Copperfield. The “miracles” of “Jesus as wonder-worker” are likewise either reasonable (casting out demons is credible because demonic possession might be an entirely psychological phenomenon), exaggerations (probable in the

case of the loaves and fishes), deceptions, or figments of the imagination (that is, stories inspired after the fact by the ‘Holy Spirit’). Jesus is like a Christmas tree, a noble pine burdened with all manner of legendary material added like tinsel to promote belief in him. Ought one not to consider Christian miracles as one considers the miracles of other faiths? Just as George Washington did not cut down an apple tree, nor is there an Easter bunny, nor does Santa Claus fly in a sleigh from the North Pole, nor is there a tooth fairy, these tales of impossible acts simply did not happen. Nor was Jesus alone in performing miracles; even Simon Magus was supposedly able to fly.

Prophetic fulfillment: This is another red flag for one seeking the real story. After Jesus’ sudden, shocking, and tragic demise, his followers frantically scoured the Old Testament for any reference they could find, or manufacture, referring to the Messiah and then created stories to write those references back into his life. Biblical sources were misinterpreted, taken out of context, or mistranslated to provide “proof” of Jesus’ Messianic role. Interestingly, Jesus didn’t even fulfill the basic requirement of the Messianic mission, that of freeing Israel from foreign domination, but followers were expecting a Messiah, so they stretched Isaiah 53 and created stories to fit all prophecies of the Messiah, and even invented a few (“He shall be called a Nazarene.”).

Witness of the Holy Spirit. Events to which no reliable human witness may be attributed are expected to be accepted on the grounds that the Holy Spirit inspired the evangelist. We may give no more credence to such stories than we do to Milton’s Paradise Lost, Dante’s Divine Comedy, or the Iliad. The Holy Spirit here is merely another avatar of the poet’s Muse.

Life of the Historical Jesus

This is as much as we may assert with a high probability of accuracy: Jesus was born in Nazareth (a backward village so insignificant it is not mentioned once in the Hebrew Scriptures or Josephus) to Mary and Joseph (Joseph is never heard from again) around 4 BCE, and had siblings - both brothers and sisters (Mk 3<A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Mark-6-3/">:3)</A>

He was born and raised as a Jew, though the area of Galilee had recently been forcibly converted to Judaism by Aristobolus I in 104 BCE, so the Jewish genealogy of Jesus’ family is subject to question. Jesus was most probably trained to be a tekton - carpenter, or construction worker of some sort, and seems to have been drawn to the apocalyptic teaching of his “cousin” (Luke 1:36, 57-60), John the Baptist. Indeed, in Matthew, Jesus’ first recorded preaching (4:17 “Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.”) is a direct quote from John, and Jesus seems to have wanted to fulfill John’s expectation of a Messiah. He began his ministry in his native Galilee, but was not well received either by his family (Mk 3:21, Mk 3:30, John 7:5), or the neighboring towns of Galilee (Mk 6:1, Lk 4:28, Mt 11:20 (=Lk10:13). Though the chief Galilean cities of Cepherus and Tiberius were within walking distance, Jesus is never recorded as having gone there. He was a prophet without honor (Mk 6:3), who had no home (Mt 8, Lk 9, John 15:18).

Much in the mold of Isaiah, he shared John’s contempt for the Pharisees (Jews who emphasize scrupulous adherence to the letter of the Law, often overlooking its spirit) and Sadducees (elitist priests of the Temple in Jerusalem, who collaborated with the Roman authorities), and was concerned for the long-suffering common people.

Around 30 CE, he went to Jerusalem at Passover, apparently to cement his reputation as a prophet and to make his Apocalyptic point, perhaps even to incite an armed uprising. He overturned the tables of money-changers and, as intended, attracted the unfavorable attention of the Jewish and Roman authorities by disrupting Temple activities and preaching the imminent revolution.

He was betrayed by his disciple Judas, who, perhaps in an attempt to force Jesus to take some miraculous action, likely told the Roman authorities that he had claimed to be the Messiah and future ruler of Palestine. Jesus was arrested (while with his band of armed “zealots”), tried by Pontius Pilate, crucified, and probably died on the cross, though Josephus tells of two men who survived crucifixion. As for his “resurrection,” he was most likely buried in a mass grave, as was customary for those

Grünewald Crucifixion 1512

crucified for treason.

His stunned and terrified followers, none of whom were directly present at his death, settled on Jesus’ identity as the (redefined) Messiah. To bolster their claim, they scoured the Hebrew Scriptures for references to the Messiah and rewrote Jesus’ story to “fulfill” the Scriptural references. Fifty to eighty years after his death, Christian proselytizers formulated their promotional literature into the Gospels.

Jesus’ Genealogy

To show the Jewish messianic legitimacy of Jesus, Matthew traces David’s line down to Joseph. The problem is that Luke also traces Jesus’ genealogy, but his is almost completely different from that of Matthew! Most damaging of all for the credibility of this section is the assertion that the Holy Spirit, not Joseph, impregnates Mary, so that the whole genealogy to Joseph is pointless! Hence Jesus is NOT from the line of David, whether or not Joseph is.

Genealogies become important during the Babylonian Captivity. The exiled priestly and ruling classes of Judah decide that YHWH brought the Babylonians to destroy Jerusalem and the Temple because of marriage to unclean local women, through whom worship of other gods spread. Thus, they each have to show their own genealogical purity by inventing a family tree that stretches back to David. This rejection of aliens is also the origin of the intense xenophobia that is still a hallmark of Judaism today.

Another, perhaps even more fundamental, motive for these genealogies is their use in asserting claim to

the land in Judah lost to the unclean lower classes during the Exile. Still, the root cause for early Christians to assert the Davidic origin of Jesus is the prophecy that the Messiah will spring from David’s line.

It’s interesting to note that Luke’s genealogy lists the father of Salathiel, the king-in-exile during the

Babylonian Captivity, not as Jeconias, the king of Judah before him, but as Neri, an otherwise unknown individual with a  unisex Hebrew name meaning “my candle.”

The Virgin Birth

Mt 1:18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. 1:19 Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily. 1:20 But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. 1:21 And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins. 1:22 Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,

1:23 Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us. (Isa 7:14) 1:24 Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife: 1:25 And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.

The angel and dream are necessitated by pregnancy

out of wedlock. Prophetic fulfillment here is based upon a mistranslation of Isaiah 7:14, which says, in Hebrew, “the young woman  (alma) is with child,”  not, as erroneously translated into Greek in the Septuagint, “a virgin” (parthenos), and taken entirely out of context. The proper context of the quote is that at that time Syria (Rezin) and Israel (Pekah) are organizing an anti-Assyrian alliance and are threatening to replace King Ahaz of Judah if he will not join. The LORD instructs Isaiah to convince Ahaz not to join the alliance. Isaiah offers a sign that

the alliance will fail: before the child that the young woman is even now carrying is old enough to eat butter and honey (to know right from wrong), the alliance will fail. This context is clear if one reads the preceding and following lines of Isaiah with the above-mentioned correction:

Is7<A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Isaiah-7-3/">:3 Then said the LORD unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz.</A>.. <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Isaiah-7-4/">4 And say unto him, Take</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Isaiah-7-4/">heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands,</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Isaiah-7-4/">for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah..</A>. <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Isaiah-7-6/">6 Let us go up against</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Isaiah-7-6/">Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set a king in the midst of it, even the</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Isaiah-7-6/">son of Tabeal: 7 Thus saith the Lord GOD, It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass..</A>. <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Isaiah-7-14/">14</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Isaiah-7-14/">Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, the young woman is with child, and she</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Isaiah-7-14/">will bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel. 15 Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Isaiah-7-15/">know to refuse the evil, and choose the good. 16 For before the child shall know to refuse the evil,</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Isaiah-7-16/">and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings.</A>

The whole nonsensical myth of Mary conceiving as a virgin is debunked. And they didn’t even name the

child Emmanuel! Outrage at this sort of blatant misreading of Scripture was a key point of friction between early Christians and Jews.

We Three Kings of Orient Are - Not!

In a story apparently intended to show the universality of Jesus’ message, Zoroastrian magi (wise men) (not kings, not three) are led by a star not to the baby Jesus, but to Herod’s palace, where they have to ask directions?! Why would the story-teller want the wise men to go to Herod’s palace? Simply in order to condemn the chief priests and scribes. Furthermore, Jesus does not fulfill the included prophecy because he is never ‘governor ruling Israel.’ Also, here Joseph and Mary live in a house in Bethlehem (no manger), whereas in Luke, they live in Nazareth (in Galilee, outside the range of the “census” of Quirinius) and are forced to go to their ancestral home (not required) by the census (actually a land assessment made in 6 CE) conducted by the newly appointed Imperial Legate, Quirinius, supposedly during the reign of Herod the Great (who had died ten years earlier, in 4 BCE).

Mt 2:1 Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, 2:2 Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him. 2:3 When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. 2:4 And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born. 2:5 And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet,

2:6 And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of

Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel. (Mic 5:2)

2:7 Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared. 2:8 And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also. 2:9 When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was. 2:10 When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy. 2:11 And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense and myrrh.

To Nazareth (M)

Matthew has to get Jesus to Nazareth somehow, so why not invent a prophecy, too? There is no Old Testament source for “He shall be called a Nazarene.” Herod Archelaus ruled Judea from 4 BCE to 6 CE, Herod Antipas ruled Galilee from 4 BCE to 39 CE

King Herod Antipas

Mt 2:19 But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, 2:20 Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child's life. 2:21 And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel. 2:22 But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee: 2:23 And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets,

He shall be called a Nazarene. (no Scriptural source)

John the Baptist (Mark)

This has the ring of a true story until 3:14, where John defers to Jesus. Who is baptizing whom here? Jesus is clearly in the inferior position, so his followers had to invent another ending. John may have been an Essene, the only practitioners of ritual lustrations. John is clearly an Apocalypticist, “The axe is laid unto the root of the trees” in the dualist (Zoroastrian) style of Daniel.

Mt 3:1 In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea, 3:2 And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. 3:3 For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. 3:4 And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey. 3:5 Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan, 3:6 And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins. 3:7 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?

3:8 Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance: 3:9 And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham. 3:10 And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. 3:11 I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance. but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire: 3:12 Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire. 3:13 Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him. 3:14 But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?  3:15 And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him. 3:16 And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: 3:17 And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.

Temptation (Mark)

Pure invention. Satan appears in Job as a member of the heavenly court, and as opposing counsel in 1 Chron 21:1, Ps 109:6, Zech 3:1-2. The explanation of evil in the world had evolved from early Zionist Triumphalism - the people of Israel were beneficiaries of the covenant and a descendant of David would always be on the throne - to Deuteronomism - the belief the Israel was being punished with the Babylonian Captivity for impiety of some sort - to  Apocalypticism - a belief based in Zoroastrian dualism that we live in an age dominated by evil - and the architect of that evil is Satan. This idea became dominant during the Hellenistic period, when it became evident that no matter how good the people were, the foreign domination continued.

Mt 4:1 Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil. 4:2 And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred. 4:3 And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread. 4:4 But he answered and said, It is written,

Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth

of God.  Deu 8:3

4:5 Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple, 4:6 And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written,

He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear

thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone. Ps 111:11

4:7 Jesus said unto him, It is written again,

Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. Deu 6:16

4:8 Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; 4:9 And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me. 4:10 Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written,

Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. Deu 6:13

4:11 Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.

To Capernaum (Mk)

Like a chess piece, Jesus is now moved to Capernaum in order to satisfy an obscure “prophecy.” Jesus here embraces John’s gospel, quoting him word for word. The prophecy cited herein is a composite of three versions of the LXX.

Mt 4:12 Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee; 4:13 And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim: 4:14 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,

4:15 The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles; 4:16 The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up. Isa 9:1-2

4:17 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

~~~~~~~

75







First Disciples (Mk)

Had Jesus met these disciples previously? Either way, their abandonment of their livelihood and father straightway is certainly intended to emphasize the renunciation involved in following Jesus and a further blow to family values.

Mt 4:18 And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers. 4:19 And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men. 4:20 And they straightway left their nets, and followed him. 4:21 And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them. 4:22 And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him.

Sermon on the Mount - Beatitudes (Q)

[The New Testament unabashedly offers rewards for certain forms of conduct. Heaven as a reward for virtuous behavior is a non-Jewish concept borrowed from Zoroastrianism along with dualistic cosmology. ]

Basilica Papale di San Francesco Assissi

Mt 5:1 And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him: 5:2 And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying, 5:3 Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 5:4 Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted. 5:5 Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth. 5:6 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled. 5:7 Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy. 5:8 Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God. 5:9 Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God. 5:10 Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 5:11 Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. 5:12 Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.

Turn the other cheek (Q)

[Jesus emphasizes that followers should be concerned not with physical well-being, but with their spiritual well-being. “Hate thine enemy” is inferred from commentary on post-Exilic dealings with Gentiles]

Mt 5:38 Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: 5:39 But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. 5:40 And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also. 5:41  And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain. 5:42 Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away. 5:43 Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy. 5:44 But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; 5:45 That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust. 5:46 For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?

5:47 And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the

publicans so?  5:48 Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.

Hypocrites: Prayer (Q)

Mt 6:5 And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. 6:6 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. 6:7 But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. 6:8 Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him. 6:9 After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. 6:10 Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. 6:11 Give us this day our daily bread. 6:12 And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. 6:13 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen. 6:14 For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: 6:15 But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.

Hypocrites: God and Mammon

How quickly money can ease the nagging conscience of churchmen who try to reconcile this Scripture with the desire to befriend the wealthy! Jesus could not have been clearer in his condemnation of those who “lay up treasures upon earth,” yet the rich and their collaborationist clergy have brazenly built their altar to Mammon and his “Gospel of Wealth” in the very sepulcher of the church.

Mt 6:19 Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: 6:20 But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: 6:21 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. 6:22 The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light. 6:23 But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness.  If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!

6:24 No man can serve two

masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. 6:25 Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?  6:26 Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?  6:27 Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?  6:28 And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: 6:29 And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. 6:30 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?  6:31 Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?  6:32 (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. 6:33 But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you. 6:34 Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.

The Golden Rule (Q)

The criterion for salvation is clear: good fruit, i.e., good works. False prophets call upon Jesus’ name, but do not perform his sayings.

Mt 7:12 Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets. 7:13 Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: 7:14 Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it. 7:15 Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. 7:16 Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?  7:17 Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. 7:18 A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. 7:19 Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. 7:20 Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. 7:21 Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. 7:22 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?  7:23 And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity. 7:24 Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock: 7:25 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock. 7:26 And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand: 7:27 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it. 7:28 And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine: 7:29 For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.

Eating with Publicans (Mk)

Publicans, or tax collectors, were unclean for a number of reasons, among which was their handling of pagan currencies and acceptance of bribes. Jesus made a point of associating with such social untouchables and praising their attitude of abject humility before God as opposed to the pride of the sanctimonious. Pharisees made a point of following the Law to a ludicrous degree, while the Essenes tried to purify themselves, expecting thereby to be admitted to the Kingdom.

Mt 9:10 And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples. 9:11 And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?  9:12 But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick. 9:13 But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.

Jesus on Family Values

One must sever family loyalties as the price of discipleship. The traditional Messianic role is rejected. Mt 10:32 Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven. 10:33 But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven. 10:34 Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword. 10:35 For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.

10:36 And a man's foes shall be they of his own household. Mic 7:6

10:37 He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. 10:38 And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me. 10:39 He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it. 10:40 He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me. 10:41 He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward. 10:42 And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward. 11:1 And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities.

….

12:46 While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him. 12:47 Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee. 12:48 But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother?  and who are my brethren?  12:49 And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren! 2:50 For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.

Parable of the Sheep and Goats

Jesus here gives a clear protocol for salvation; namely, to help those in need, even anonymously. This is in stark contrast to the criteria for salvation as given by Paul, which became the orthodox teaching; namely, faith in Jesus and baptism. Paul’s logic is that if doing good were enough to warrant entrance into the Kingdom of Heaven, then Jesus need not have died upon the cross, which is true: he didn’t need to die that way. Paul, however, was obsessed with the resurrection as the key aspect of Christianity. Thus Paul, on his own authority, subverts possibly the single most important teaching of Jesus.

Mt 25:31 “When the Son of man shall come in his

glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: 25:32 And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall  separate  them  one  from  another,  as  a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats: 25:33 And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. 25:34 Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed  of  my  Father,  inherit  the  kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: 25:35 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: 25:36 Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me:

I was in prison, and ye came unto me. 25:37 Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?  25:38 When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?  25:39 Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?  25:40 And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me. 25:41 Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels: 25:42 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink: 25:43 I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not. 25:44 Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?  25:45 Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me. 25:46 And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.”

Jesus’ brother James, leader of the early Church, also emphasized the primacy of charity (good works), but at his death, church fathers chose Paul’s sacramental model based upon baptism and faith, because if random kindness is the key to salvation, one really doesn’t need a church.

The Last Supper (Mk)

By dipping his hand into the relish “with” Jesus and not waiting until Jesus as leader had dipped, Judas asserted his leadership over the group, according to one interpretation.

The Last Supper Leonardo da Vinci

26:17 Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?  26:18 And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples. 26:19 And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover. 26:20 Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve. 26:21 And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me. 26:22 And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?  26:23 And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me. 26:24 The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born. 26:25 Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I?  He said unto him, Thou hast said. 26:26 And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. 26:27 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; 26:28 For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.  26:29 But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.

Gethsemane (Mk)

There are numerous citations of Zechariah in these last chapters of Matthew, here about the shepherds and the Mount of Olives.

26:30 And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives. 26:31 Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written,

I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad Zech 13:7.

26:32 But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee. 26:33 Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended. 26:34 Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. 26:35 Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples. 26:36 Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder. 26:37 And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy. 26:38 Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me. 26:39 And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt. 26:40 And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?  26:41 Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. 26:42 He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done. 26:43 And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy. 26:44 And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words. 26:45 Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.26:46 Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.

Arrest (Mk)

John tells us that Judas left the group during the dinner. In greeting Jesus first, Judas again abrogates the relationship required by protocol. It is noteworthy that at least one of Jesus’ followers was armed - a violation of Roman law and indication that an armed revolution was within their expectations of this Messiah. This also explains Judas’ betrayal of Jesus in that Judas hopes by revealing that Jesus considers himself the King of the Jews to force Jesus to take miraculous action.

Kiss of Judas by Giotto

Mt 26:47 And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people. 26:48 Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast. 26:49 And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him. 26:50 And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus and took him. 26:51 And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear. 26:52 Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. 26:53 Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?  26:54 But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?

26:55 In that same hour said Jesus to the

multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me. 26:56 But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.

Before the Council (Mk)

Claiming to be the Messiah was not technically blasphemous, but was traitorous to Rome. Messiahship including leading an armed revolt. The evangelist seems clearly to be attempting to shift blame for the crucifixion from the Romans to the Jews.

Jesus before the High Priest

26:57 And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled. 26:58 But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end. 26:59 Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death; 26:60 But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses, 26:61 And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days. 26:62 And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?  26:63 But Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God. 26:64 Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you,

Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in

the clouds of heaven. Daniel 7:13 ff.

26:65 Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy. 26:66 What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death. 26:67 Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands, 26:68 Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?

Death of Judas (Q)

Mistranslation of Zecherian prophecy, misattribution to Jeremiah. Also, Matthew’s account differs from that in Acts1:18 “Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and falling headlong he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.” Some artistic portrayals incorporate both legends.

Mt 27:3 Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,

27:4 Saying, I have

sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that. 27:5 And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself. 27:6 And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood. 27:7 And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in. 27:8 Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day. 27:9 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying,

And they took the thirty pieces of silver,

the price of him that was valued, whom

they of the children of Israel did value;

27:10 And gave them for the potter's

field, as the Lord appointed me.

Zec 11:12-13

Questioning (Mk)

Pilate goes directly to the point of the arrest. Though we have no record of Jesus calling himself King of the Jews publicly, someone told Pilate that he had - Judas!

Mt 27:11 And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest. 27:12 And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing. 27:13 Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?  27:14 And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.

Barabbas (Mk)

Why in the world would Pilate release an insurrectionist on the eve of Passover? There is no external attestation of such a process. Also, his name seems a bit too generic: Bar-abbas - ‘son of the father.’ This seems to be an attempt to further inculpate the Jews in Jesus’ death.

27:15 Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.

27:16  And  they  had  then  a  notable

prisoner, called Barabbas. 27:17 Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?

27:18

For he knew that for envy they had delivered him. 27:19 When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him. 27:20 But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus. 27:21 The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas. 27:22 Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified. 27:23 And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified. 27:24 When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it. 27:25 Then

answered all the people,and said, His blood be on us, and on our children. 27:26 Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.

Crucifixion (Mk)

In Luke, one of the bandits repents. The Synoptic Gospels have Simon of Cyrene carrying Jesus’ cross, but John says he bears it himself (John 19:17); furthermore, the Synoptic Gospels have Jesus being crucified on the day after the Passover meal (Last Supper), while John, for poetic effect, has Jesus die as the lambs are being killed for the meal.

Mt 27:32 And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross. 27:33 And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull, 27:34 They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink. 27:35 And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots. 27:36 And sitting down they watched him there; 27:37 And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS. 27:38 Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left. 27:39 And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads, 27:40 And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross. 27:41 Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said, 27:42 He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him. 27:43 He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God. 27:44 The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.

Death (Mk)

Darkness from noon to 3:00 pm, reminiscent of the darkness over Egypt before the first Passover, was most probably added for dramatic effect, as were the sheeted dead emerging from their tombs. Based on his “Eli…” citation, Jesus apparently learned the Psalms in Aramaic. Elias (Elijah) was a prophet who did not die, but was taken up into Heaven by a chariot of fire, and would come to the aid of the distressed. Josephus has an account of an earthquake before the fall of Jerusalem in 70. Mt: John; Mk 14-15, John 18-19, died on different days. Note also that none of his followers was present, but only some women “beholding afar off.”

Mt 27:45 Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour. 27:46 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,

Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? Ps 22:1

that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?  27:47 Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias. 27:48 And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink. 27:49 The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him. 27:50 Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost. 27:51 And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent; 27:52 And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose, 27:53 And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many. 27:54 Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God. 27:55 And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him: 27:56 Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedees children.

92







Burial (Mk)

Joseph, a member of the very Council that had unanimously condemned Jesus to death, sought Jesus’ body secretly from Pilate according to John 19:38. Josephus relates that bodies of crucified criminals were taken down and buried before evening of the Sabbath. Criminals were sometimes secretly rescued in this way. Legs were broken to hasten death.

Mt 27:57 When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple: 27:58 He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered. 27:59 And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, 27:60 And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed. 27:61 And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre. 27:62 Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate, 27:63 Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again. 27:64 Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first. 27:65 Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as sure as ye can. 27:66 So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.

~~~~~~~

93







Resurrection (Mk)

Mark had no tradition of a sealed and guarded tomb, and the women came merely to dress the body, which is far more likely. Luke has the Apostles meeting Jesus in Emmaeus, a suburb of Jerusalem. The difference between Galilee and Jerusalem as the point of meeting may reflect tension between the Christians of Galilee (north) and those of Judea (south). ‘Extension’(MkX) refers to the continuation of the Gospel of Mark added during the Middle Ages. The original ends at Mark 16:8.

Who went to the tomb: Magdalene (Mk, Mt, L, J), Mary mother of James (Mk, Mt, L), Salome (Mk), Joanna (L), Galilean women (L)

What was seen: Stone already rolled away (Mk, L, J), angel rolls back stone (Mt), one man (Mk, Mt), two men (L, J)

What was done: Told he is risen (Mk, Mt, L), they flee (Mk), Jesus appears to Magdalene, then two others, then to the eleven, he gives commission, he ascends (Mk X); Magdalene and “the other Mary” meet him, hold his feet (Mt); the women tell the apostles, who not believe them, Peter runs, sees linen, Jesus appears to Cleopas (Simon?), is not recognized, teaches, is recognized, vanishes, appears to the eleven, eats, gives commission, ascends (L); Magdalene tells John and Peter the body has been taken, they run, see the linen, leave, Magdalene sees Jesus, thinks he is the gardener, recognizes him, told not to touch him, Jesus appears to the eleven, breathes the Holy Ghost on them; eight days later Jesus again appears to Thomas, later appears again, helps them fish (J).

Where are the Apostles to meet Jesus?    Galilee (Mk, Mt), Jerusalem (MkX, L, J)

~~~~~~~~

Final Commission (Mk)

The baptismal injunction seems to be from a post-Nicene orthodoxy. Mt 28:16 Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them. 28:17 And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted. 28:18 And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying,

All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.

28:19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, Dan 7:14

baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: 28:20 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.

So then, why believe?

So, given the glaring inconsistencies, anachronisms, evidence of tampering, etc., what then would induce otherwise intelligent people to believe steadfastly, or at least profess to believe, in the infallibility of these doctrines? There are numerous reasons to do so, some nobler than others.  There is a considerable degree of overlap between them.

Here are the reasons gathered and categorized so far, given alphabetically: Ambition: Armed with a few quotes from the Apostle Paul, a person can speak with authority and climb as high as her temerity will allow. Wrapped in the cloak of righteousness, she can attack all enemies with impunity and then, when attacked in return, hide behind the crucifix. Now she can go out and impose “God’s Word” on the larger sphere. She now has a host of new powers to impose on the world, perhaps to shame and intimidate, perhaps to self-righteously condemn, perhaps to take an authoritative role in a discussion or decision, perhaps to feel superior through comfort or “spiritual” advice; always aiming at a position of control “in the name of God.” We all know well enough to what horrific ends these powers will reach if unchecked: burning “heretics” alive, etc. A church, no matter how small, is often the arena for personality struggles between its members, for whom faith is an opportunity to exert dominance. When a religious establishment dominates a town, it becomes the rostrum for social ascension.

Authority: How dare I doubt when great and learned men and women before have expressed firm belief? What right have I to doubt their authority? What do I know that they didn’t? They can’t all be wrong, can they? When both parents and other authoritative figures in society insist upon the truth of a certain belief, who has the gumption to question it? Lack of intellectual confidence goes a long way to explain this impulse. Then, when children discover inconsistencies in their religion, they are merely told that it’s a “mystery” and they must accept it on “faith.””Blessed are those that have not seen, yet still believe.”

Class struggle: Both Christianity and Buddhism prospered initially because they appealed to a large underclass with little hope of social advancement under the pre-Christian/pre-Buddhist social hierarchy. Churches offer them a glimpse of equality and self-importance.

Comfort in distress through resignation to God’s Will - In The Brothers Karamazov, as the Elder Zosima attempts to comfort the woman whose children have all died, he goes through the usual laundry list of pious explanations: your child is in Heaven now looking down on us; God is testing your faith; etc. The best consolation for the bereaved is the belief that they are in a better place and that we’ll see them again if we submit to the church.

Community: A powerful carrot and a stick. Members support each other emotionally and economically to keep the community as a whole alive. I know of many people who depend on church associations for their livelihood. If they were to question doctrine, they would endanger the economic viability of their way of life. Is it worth it, just to exercise your “freedom of thought” to call down upon you and your family the rage of the community that feeds you? Religious communities also offer safety in numbers. The need to belong is basic in human beings: a need satisfied by the military, sports teams, schools,

95







gangs, and churches. This is especially true in smaller “religious” towns, where everyone knows who the doubter is among them. Shunning is thus a potent tool to keep people on the straight and narrow, whether they really believe the doctrine or not. Mob psychology is an effective form of enforcing unity. The primal fear of isolation or dying alone is also soothed by church communities. Persecution also tightens community bonds and portrays the doubter as a treasonous coward.

Confusion: People who feel overwhelmed and disoriented by life can get soothing, authoritative, narcotizing answers to dilemmas such as global warming, overpopulation, nuclear proliferation, death of children, social injustice, and terrorism.

Diffidence: People who fear being seen as prideful, or who actually have low self-esteem, can find strength within themselves to go beyond their self-imposed limitations, and can ascribe that strength not to their puny egos, but to a “higher power.” In so doing, they can parade their talents, but only so long as all credit is given to this higher power, so as to shield them from seeming proud (which they are). This externalization of praise and blame empowers people to commit acts of greater courage or of greater cruelty than they thought possible, while under the sway of the “spirit.” Ironically, the more intelligent a person is, the less confidence one has in her own judgment. Thus do many geniuses fall prey to theological nonsense.

Escapism: Sometimes, the reaction to an unsatisfying life is to escape to the imaginary, narcotizing True World of religion - the apocalypse, the afterlife - or back to a glorious past (that never existed) associated with "old time religion" (meaning Catholicism?) Encouraged by “faith,” one can deny the realities of an inconvenient world, expunge guilt, and overcome shame.

Family harmony: “Our mother would turn over in

her grave, if she knew that you had left the church!” Deviating from the family’s religion entails friction and risk. Finally breaking with the superstitions supported by a family for generations requires great courage and confidence. Yet even then, the knowledge that certain family members - especially the older or less sophisticated folks respected and beloved from childhood - will feel heart-broken or betrayed is a significant incentive to postpone or cancel one’s “selfish, prideful” free-thinking.

Fear: There are manifold fears associated with religion: fear of isolation from friends and family, fear of revenge of the “faithful,” fear of Hell (there isn’t really one, right?), fear of the pointlessness of life if you are right that we are just random emanations of energy hurtling through space, fear of dying alone. Religion overcomes fear by embracing it (bolstered by the guarantee of an afterlife not merely of physical security, but of permanent ecstasy). Religion harnesses and makes sense out of primal fears: the Absurd here corresponds to Nietzsche’s Dionysian impulse; the Individual Unconscious acts as an eddy in the Collective, individuated by trauma: hence the irresistible allure of Hitler, ISIS, Trump, religion. To this category belong superstitions of various forms: seeking security in a frightening world, fear of an afterlife, Then there’s the Existential fear that life is pointless, in answer to which theologians have devised True World theories and championed the Ascetic Ideal. In these thought- experiments, the True World (Heaven) is what matters - this world is a nuisance; the purpose of life is to gain entry into Heaven. This solution solves the need for purpose in life and panders to people’s

need for self-esteem, while making their salvation the central concern of all creation (It really is all about me!).

Feminism: The Cult of Domesticity conceded to women the field of spirituality, and from the earliest days of the church, women played important roles that allowed them a channel to vent their frustrations with paternalistic society. Church is sometimes the only venue for women to express themselves, pseudo-St. Paul notwithstanding.

Financial Enrichment: A decent living can be made by offering a range of religious services. I still recall Reverend Ike on the radio as I drove across South Carolina in the 1970’s. “For a double portion gift, you get a double portion blessing!” Evangelism is the last refuge for those who couldn’t make a living selling shoes.

Game Theory: Believing entails less risk than not believing because if there are a Heaven and Hell, I’m better off covering my bets by believing, while if there are no such places, I lose nothing.

Goodness booster shot: Some persons go to church for the inspiration to be a better person, and it seems to work: church-goers generally tend to try to be nicer people.

Guilt: One of the most despicable psychological methods used to coerce people into church is to project upon them, from earliest youth, guilt for actions that supposedly happened long ago. The first thing these “loving parents” do is to burden the minds of their trusting children with the idea that they are sinful, utterly depraved, and deserve damnation, and God knows every thought you have! The Catholic Church is especially skilled at this one, having a sacrament whereby all you need to do is tell the priest every sinful action or unclean thought you have ever had, then you’re magically forgiven and the sins disappear from your soul! Another angle on guilt is the progression:

“The church educated you; your good religious parents raised you; the church community

supported you to go to that damned college where you learned to betray the trust of everyone who should matter in your life. You’re just on an ego trip! You arrogant ass, how you love to sneer at the beliefs of good, kind people that crave comfort in their hour of need! What do you have to offer in the place of our ‘superstition’? Science?!”

Hope: In times of desperation and loneliness, people need hope. Militant Islam has arisen at this time because the once-proud kingdoms of the Middle East have been effectively castrated for the last two hundred years. Religion becomes an integral part of individual identity. Submission (like a frontal lobotomy) is the path to happiness. Righteousness becomes the armor and weaponry of social outcasts. Those whose lives suck, who have been disappointed in love or career, can find acceptance, consolation, and power. This is an especially effective lure to those without hope of improvement of their lot - the chronically poor, the outcasts, druggies, the defeated. The promise of a better life in the next world to those who bear their fate in obedience to God (the church) is balm to their hurt minds. Conversely, former addicts often cite religion as the key to their rehabilitation. Half-way houses run by churches often actually help people get back on their feet.

Immortality: The idea of death is abhorrent to many, so they gravitate to a belief system that satisfies their egotism.

Indoctrination: “Why do you believe that?” “Because the church says so. There is nothing you or anyone can say that will ever shake my faith!” “Ok, but faith in what?” “I believe whatever the church says I should believe!” The church is the font of religious Truth, and like the Communist Party, cannot err. Pope Pius IX said so! From earliest childhood children are indoctrinated to accept absurdities as truths, and any wavering or questioning is treated as heresy.

Inertia: Many of the less thoughtful among us believe out of mere laziness.

Intellectual curiosity: People cannot accept that we are nothing more than random emanations of cosmic energy. Their egos demand that we are more central to the plan, that we are the purpose of the entirety of creation.

Intellectual insecurity: People who were never very intelligent find an easy way to take the moral high ground and stand up to the smarty-pants secular humanists. Likewise, persons cognizant of their own intellectual limitations are easily convinced to swallow church doctrine hook, line, and sinker.

Justice: Those who can't let injustice have the last laugh, who refuse to accept that bad things happen to good people, and that bad people aren’t punished for what they have done, must believe that there is someone keeping score who will dispense justice to the good and evil.

Justification : Religion is a potent weapon to justify almost any crime against humanity. Slavery was justified by religious leaders quoting the bible, as are wars, both defensive and offensive, opportunistic attacks upon one’s social or economic rivals, and the burning of people at the stake, pogroms, and lynchings - all performed by church-going Christians.

Loneliness, especially the desire for reunion with loved ones who have died. A local Jehovah’s Witness used to come by from time to time to try to convert me. When I let slip that my mother had died when I was four years old, she immediately went to work on that. The next time she showed up, she had a brochure that showed how I would be reunited with my mother in Heaven, if I joined her group. Here the religious organization plays the dangerous role of quack psychiatrist to people who have suffered emotional trauma, and always with the same prescription: “Complete unquestioning faith in our organization will solve all your problems. Just have faith in (what we tell you about) Jesus.” Conversely, churches also offer a place a stranger can go and have immediate acceptance, a place where she can feel she belongs. The fellowship churches offer also relieves the fear that one will die alone and forgotten. Seeing friendly, supportive faces once a week is very comforting.

Masochism: Children who are tricked by their loving parents into believing that the dark shadow of original sin hangs over them, and that the body is inherently “sinful,” not to mention that God knows their every thought (worse than 1984), must be burdened with abundant guilt. Add to that the hidden terror of someone who has actually done something wrong, or whom the doctrine classifies as sexually

deviant, and it is understandable that many look to religion for a purifying punishment which they know they deserve; hence they welcome punishment and practice asceticism, self-flagellation, etc.

Morality: Many believe that morals are the proper province of religion rather than philosophy, and that Judeo-Christian morals are superior. Morality is taught in churches, so people associate the church with morality, and morality with social order; thus have churches co-opted social mores and claimed a monopoly on goodness, yet too often fail to speak out against the immorality of the flock - hence the acquiescence to slavery from 1619 on, the emergence of the “Southern” (no blacks allowed) Methodist church in 1844, the anti-working class “Acres of Diamonds” gospel of the 1880’s, and the hateful, xenophobic movements against Jews, Catholics, the Irish, Germans, Chinese, gays, and Muslims.

Mystical Union: People who want to experience the eternal, unchanging seminal power of the universe beyond the reach of reason use various means - meditation, incantations, prayer, a life of selfless service, etc. Churches sometimes offer such paths, but seldom without a load of superstitious nonsense.

Need for explanations: Personal experience of the “supernatural” (dreams, lightning on a sunny day, etc.) requires some explanation, and science cannot answer every question, yet. Hence, every unexplained phenomenon becomes a “proof” of the existence of some deity.

Nostalgia: Religion manipulates images of happiness, victory, justice, and order, as well as the hope of meeting long lost family members or friends in the next life.

Philanthropy: For some folks, the doctrine is not as important as the opportunity to serve the needy. In answer to Jesus’ call to clothe the naked, and feed the hungry, like Chaucer’s “pauvre Persoun,” they flock to churches, synagogues, mosques, and temples to help out those in need.

Philosophical exchange: Some folks like to exchange inspirational ideas with others of generally the same mind, thereby achieving an intellectual high.

Physical needs: From the beginning, people have turned to gods for basic security. “Give us food, rain, sun, etc.” “Let my child survive this plague.” “Protect our house from this tornado.” “Let our nation repel the invader.” When the seagulls arrive or a child recovers, or the tornado passes them by, or the invader is defeated, it is proof of the efficacy of worship/prayer. What’s interesting are the mental gymnastics exhibited when such help is not forthcoming. The most successful religions have been through cycles of depression and defeat, and have a number of ready rationalizations for failure of divine salvation. Classified under the title of Theodicy, these justifications include such time-worn excuses for the failure of God to protect “his people” as: “We have sinned and are being punished” (often with side-long glances at the presumed guilty party), or “We are being tested,” or “God works in ways beyond our comprehension.” And when an innocent baby dies - “She was guilty of original sin,” or “You’ll see her again in Heaven,” or, strangest of all, “God punishes those whom he loves.”  Supplied with these defense mechanisms, a religion may deflect blame for failing its most basic task and may survive, though diminished, although no one yet can explain where God was during the Holocaust. And when even that doesn't account for God’s failures, then cynics turn to apocalypticism, “We live in an evil age, but fear not, the end is near at hand!”

99







Political Action: Not only was the abolition movement born out of Great Awakening evangelism, but the temperance and civil rights movements as well. Liberation Theology of the 1960’s mobilized many religious people to take direct political action.

Political organization: The church is often a positive political agent in a community, as were the black churches during the civil rights movement.

Pragmatism: Sometimes people join a religion in order to associate with the strongest social class or dominant element; likewise, for an oppressed group, religion is the focus of their strength and security in numbers; further, folks can get a job or find a spouse by joining a certain religious group. Sometimes the motive is to make friends or find a “safe” date.

Pride: People are unwilling to admit their error, especially after indoctrinating their own children. Hypocrisy, especially when widely shared, is easier than humiliation.

Reason for living: People are unwilling to believe that beyond self-gratification their lives are pointless. Faith is often contrasted to nihilism, wherein life serves no purpose.

Reason: a) I (or someone whose judgment I trust) witnessed a miracle (i.e., saw something I/she can’t explain), so there must be supernatural phenomena; therefore I will submit to the doctrine of the church!? b) There must be an after-life because I have seen dead people in my dreams. c) This universe cannot have been random. Humans are too subtle to have evolved from pond scum. It makes sense to have a creator-god. d) Scripture is so convincing in its detail and weighty thought (though that would also recommend the Mahabharata).

Ritual: The grand theater of High Mass with its majestic sights, sounds, and scents is intoxicating.

Sadism: Where there is so much desire for correction (see Masochism above), can they be far behind who will gladly dispense the punishment ascribed by Heaven? The Bible unfortunately lends itself readily to perverted abuse by parents, spouses, preachers, and others who feel themselves qualified to express God’s wrath at human failing. This punishment can be physical or, more dangerously, emotional. Having heard the tearful confessions of a teenager who is a serial offender against God’s clear indictment against sexual promiscuity, what dutiful priest would be so remiss as not to whip the fear of God into any such errant youth (while also releasing his libidinal tension)?

Security: People feel reassured when swaddled in the faith of their fathers. In times of trouble, people long for the security of their infancy, when their believer-parents cradled them and taught them “As I lay me down to sleep…”

Sex with children (clergy only, please!): Catholic priests, possibly because they are forbidden to marry, repeatedly run afoul of social norms in their exuberance to ram the fear of God into young boys and girls. Additionally, ages-long suppression of homosexuals has led naturally to the gravitation of persons so inclined to the priesthood, where they can live out their fantasies while protected by the Church. Mormon preachers are also allowed to express their love of God on underage girls completely legally,

100







sometimes even with the coercive encouragement of the child’s parents.  Leaders of cults also often find this particular perk irresistible.

Stubbornness (~Pride above): Though they recognize the rational and psychological superiority of the opposing argument, some people are simply unwilling to give their (obviously demonic) adversary the satisfaction.

Survival (~Community above): Persecuted religious minorities identify with their religion and believe they must stick together to survive.

Vanity: The church becomes “my team” and maybe even has a flag, to which one can feel a form of “patriotism.”

These reasons are potent by themselves, but when used in combination, they are nearly insurmountable for an adult, much less a child.

False Prophets

How do we know a false prophet?

‘When a prophet speaketh in the name of the LORD, if the thing follow not, nor come to

pass, that is the thing which the LORD hath not spoken, but the prophet hath spoken it

presumptuously: thou shalt not be afraid of him.’  (Deu 18:22)

Obviously all those who have hitherto predicted the end of the world have been wrong, and are therefore, by the biblical definition, false prophets. It’s an impressive list. Notice how much more frequent they have become recently. The date given is that of the predicted End.
