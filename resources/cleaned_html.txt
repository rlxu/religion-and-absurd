Definitions:

Religion - a set of doctrines which requires faith in metaphysical phenomena (i.e., gods, miracles, afterlife, power of prayer, etc.). If a set of doctrines does not require faith, then it does not qualify as a religion, but only as a philosophy. Many religions claim a mutually exclusive right to Truth - they maintain that their religion is right, and all others are wrong - while others are more inclusive.

The Absurd - a phenomenon which defies reasonable explanation.

Soeren Kierkegaard (hereafter K), whose Fear and Trembling posits acceptance of the Absurd as prerequisite for faith, uses the example of Abraham’s unquestioning resolve to kill his son Isaac based only upon the command of a voice in his head that he identified as God. K considers this action Absurd because it defies logic and social custom. Christian dogma, according to K, embodies paradoxes which are offensive to reason. (Indeed, were someone today to say that he intended to kill his child because a voice in his head had instructed him to, we too might react with Fear and Trembling!) There are two attitudes one can adopt to this assertion: viz., one can take K’s leap of faith and believe, or one can doubt. What one may not do, according to K, is have faith by virtue of reason. If one chooses faith, one must suspend reason. In fact one must believe by virtue of the Absurd.

K notwithstanding, A rational individual should apply the same objectivity to her own beliefs as she would to those of another, for who would not agree that the believers in other gods are wrong?

Spirituality or Religion? I personally am not an atheist - it seems self-evident to me that there is something behind the wondrous universe in which we live, and that intuitive knowledge can lead to insights into its nature - but I am wary of pre-scientific legends that later claim factual credibility (inerrancy). I object to the presentation of religion as based in fact and science, and I feel there is copious evidence that exposes these stories as myth or legend. I have, however, included rebuttals to my assertions and I welcome readers to offer their own rebuttals where they think I have erred.

Religion performs useful social functions and is cherished by a great many people, but is also responsible for enormous monstrosities in human history. Like a rifle which may be used either for hunting and for personal protection or for mass murder, so religion in the right hands may be a productive element in society, but in the wrong hands a powerful destructive force. Perhaps the greatest flaws in religion are that it teaches people from earliest youth to reject objectivity and to blindly follow fairy tales, and that it depersonalizes judgment so that, for example, an otherwise civilized person might kill his own child on a whim.

Evolution of the Relationship between Religion and Science

1. The Primitive Period

In the beginning, all was mysterious, terrifying, and wonderful. Man did not understand the origin of earthquakes, lightning, or how the sun got from the west back to the east for sunrise the next morning. Why did plants grow? Why did people get sick and die? People were desperate for answers, which they found according to what seemed most reasonable. Wherever a phenomenon defied natural explanation, some supernatural agency was presumed. Further, people desperately wanted to be able to control these phenomena and so instituted sacrifices and prayers in the belief that these actions could influence the appropriate deities. At this point religion and science were synonymous.

2. The Growth of Science

As knowledge of the physical world increasingly showed non-spiritual causes of phenomena, entrenched religious authorities threatened with a diminution in the scope of their influence reacted forcefully against the “impious” assertions of secular knowledge.

3. The  Current State of Affairs

As science continues to advance our understanding of the world and ourselves, the original rationale for religion itself is progressively undermined. Confronted with refutations of core beliefs, religionists have responded in a variety of ways: some modify their beliefs to accommodate science, while some seek alternate realities. Even science has been posited as a religion of sorts by some apologists of faith. In some cases, the entrenched interests of organized religion and social conservatism have instituted a war against science itself and the public schools that bring unwelcome ideas into their communities.

4. The persistence of superstition (i.e., faith, prayer, miracles, etc.)

Why do parents encourage their children to believe in obvious falsehoods: Santa Claus, turning water to wine, the “Virgin” Mary, the gift of tongues? Why do people persist in the belief that prayers are efficacious? Did the people whose house was hit by the tornado not pray hard enough? Besides, isn’t a prayer simply a request that God change his Divine Plan in order to accommodate one’s personal desire? Isn’t it a rejection of “thy will be done”? We will investigate these questions below.

Part One - A Chronological Consideration of Judaeo-Christian Theology: Historical Overview of pre-Christian Israel:

The history of the Hebrew people is well documented by outside sources (Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Persia, Greece, Rome) as well as by Jewish historians and Scripture. Absent the mythology, what seems most likely is that the Hebrews migrated from Mesopotamia to the highlands of Canaan around 1700 BCE, and brought with them numerous religious myths. Around the time of Solomon these stories were crystallized in the Scripture by authors known as J (Jehovist) and E (Elohist), with later additions by D (Deuteronomist), Chron (icler), Prophets, and P (Priests).

David’s kingdom then split into Samaria (Israel) in the north, with a temple at Shiloh served by Aaronite priests; and Judea in the south, with a temple at Jerusalem served by Zadokite priests. There was widespread on-going polytheistic worship of El, Baal, and Asherah, as well as an incipient monotheism centered on YHWH (Jehovah), the newly enshrined war-god of Judea. Judean Prophets soon emerged who demanded exclusive worship of YHWH, and their warnings of the dangers of inclusive Yahwism (worship of other gods along with YHWH) seemed vindicated when Samaria fell to Assyria in 722 BCE. At this point D rewrites Scripture to prophesy the fall of Samaria, perpetual Davidic kingship, etc.

In 586 BCE, though, faith in YHWH was tested when Jerusalem was conquered and the Temple destroyed by Babylonians. Judean leaders and priests were removed to Babylon (Babylonian Exile), during which time they retooled their theology to account for what had happened. They concluded that YHWH was punishing them for apostasy (allowing the worship of Baal and Asherah - El had already been assimilated into YHWH) and genealogical impurity (intermarriage with the “unclean” Canaanite women). Their history was rewritten by P and Chron to emphasize the myths of Moses, the Exodus, and a mythic conquest of Canaan.

When they returned to Palestine with their new Scriptures and genealogies in hand, these Babylonian exiles reclaimed “their” land and imposed a harsh, xenophobic regime of exclusive Yahwism. Scripture had been rewritten by these Judean exilic returnees, so it is small wonder that exclusive Yahwism predominates in Scripture at the expense of northern, Samarian inclusivity.

This did not lead to the liberation of Judea from foreign domination, however. The Babylonians were followed by the Persians with their Zoroastrian dualism, and then the Greeks, who offered a sophisticated individualistic philosophy and a cosmopolitan worldview that appealed to many affluent Jews. This threat was met by further xenophobic isolation and a stronger sense of identification with mythic Tradition. The failure of their piety to liberate them from foreign domination, encouraged by Zoroastrian dualism, finally led to the theology of Apocalypticism - the belief present both in Daniel and the Gospels - that we are living in an age dominated by evil that can only be saved by direct, imminent divine intervention.

Adam and Eve

Exactly why were Adam and Eve expelled from the Garden of Eden? It’s probably not why you think. The evidence strongly suggests that this story was intended as a myth: a man named Man, a woman named Woman, and a talking snake. (All citations are from the King James Version):

Genesis 2:15 And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. 16 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: 17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die. …3:1 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? 2 And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:

3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. 4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: 5 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. 6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat. 7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons. 8 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden. 9 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou? 10 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself. 11 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat? 12 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat. 13 And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat. … 22 And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever: 23 Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken. 24 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.

So Adam and Eve didn’t die the day they ate the fruit, as God had said they would; they could have lived forever, had they eaten the fruit of the Tree of Life; and after they had become as gods God banished them from Eden to prevent their immortality. Not the Sunday school version.

Noah’s Ark

In the story of the Flood, P (the Priestly source) and J (the Yahwist source) differ in the number of animals to be brought onboard, and how long the flood lasted. Here the two stories are separated:

“P” Flood Numbers
6:19 And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female. 20 Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive...7:11 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened. 24 And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days… 8:3 and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated. 4 And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat. 5 And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen. 13 And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: 14 And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried. (=376 days)

“J” Flood Numbers

7:2 Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female. 3 Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth. 4 For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights… 8:6 And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:

7 And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth. 8 Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground; 9 But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark. 10 And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark; 11 And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth. 12 And he stayed yet other seven days and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more. 13… and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry. (= 61 days, calculating seven days after the raven, because in verse 10 he says “other” = “another” seven days; otherwise, 54 days.)

Rebuttal: The mediaeval Jewish commentator, Rashi, explains that what scripture means is that a pair of all “unclean” - ritually impure - animals is meant and 7 pair of ritually “clean” animals.

~~~~~~~

The Joseph Story

Even more noteworthy is the weaving together of the J (southern Yahwist source) and E (the northern Elohist source) strands of the Joseph story, in which the two diverge markedly. Note that the southern source prefers Judah and the northern source prefers Reuben, the first-born, in the leadership role:

In brief, Joseph was hated by his brothers, who one day sold him and/or put him into a well and faked his death. Joseph ends up in Egypt and works his way up from slave to valued advisor to the Prime Minister for the Pharaoh. His brothers come to Egypt during a famine and are brought before him.  The do not recognize him. He accuses them of being spies and demands that they bring his father and youngest brother back. When they return, he reveals his identity and is reunified with his family. They stay in Egypt. The father Jacob (Israel) dies, is embalmed and buried in Canaan. Joseph dies, is embalmed and buried in Egypt. The family stays in Egypt until the Exodus.

There are numerous inconsistencies in the story, which are outlined below, along with a rebuttal to the claim of inconsistency according to the mediaeval Jewish scholar Rashi.

in “J” (Genesis)

in “E” (Genesis)

Who saves Joseph?

Judah (37:26)

Reuben (37:21)

Joseph is

sold to Ishmaelites (37:25,27)  found by Midianites (37:28)

brought to Egypt by

Ishmaelites (37:28)

Midianites (37:36)

brothers’ bags opened

at the inn (42:9)

at home (42:35)

surety for Benjamin

Judah (43:3)

Reuben (42:37)

Rebuttal: Reuben advised not shedding Joseph’s blood but rather to throw him into the pit with the idea perhaps of rescuing Joseph later. After Joseph was thrown into the pit, Judah suggested that Joseph could be saved by selling him to the caravan of traders.
Ishmaelites vs Midianites: Rashi says this indicates that Joseph was sold several times. First sold to the Ishmaelites who sold him to Midianites who then sold him to the Egyptians.
Bag opened in camp vs at home: One of the brothers opens his bag at the inn and discovers the money (It is inferred that this is Levi). Later back home the other brothers also find money in their own bags. Why didn’t all the brothers open their sacks? Double sided sacks, money at the bottom of all sacks except that of Levi, who was most guilty for sale of Joseph. Evidently Joseph wanted only one tranche of money to be discovered which would not have brought them back to Egypt immediately professing innocence. Rather he wanted them to discover the money only after they reached home.

<A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canaan">Canaan</A> in the Late Bronze Age

was a shadow of what it had been centuries earlier: many cities had been abandoned, others had shrunk in size, and the total settled population was probably not much more than a hundred thousand. Settlement was concentrated in cities along the coastal plain and along major trade routes. The central and northern hill country which would later become the biblical kingdom of Israel was only sparsely inhabited, and <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</A> was a Canaanite city-state recognizing Egyptian suzerainty. Politically and culturally, Egypt was dominant; each Canaanite city had its own ruler, but was often at odds with its neighbors, appealing to Egypt to adjudicate differences. The city-state system broke down during the <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Bronze_Age_collapse">Late Bronze Age,</A> and Canaanite culture was then gradually absorbed into that of the <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philistines">Philistines, Phoenicians</A> and Israelites. The process was gradual and a strong <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt">Egyptian</A>  presence continued into the 12th century BCE.

Deconstructing the Walls of Jericho - Ze'ev Herzog

This is what archaeologists have learned from their excavations in the Land of Israel: the Israelites were never in Egypt, did not wander in the desert, did not conquer the land in a military campaign and did not pass it on to the 12 tribes of Israel. Perhaps even harder to swallow is the fact that the united monarchy of David and Solomon, which is described by the Bible as a regional power, was at most a small tribal kingdom. And it will come as an unpleasant shock to many that the God of Israel, Jehovah, had a female consort (Asherah) and that the early Israelite religion adopted monotheism only in the waning period of the monarchy and not at Mount Sinai. Most of those who are engaged in scientific work in the interlocking spheres of the Bible, archaeology and the history of the Jewish people - and who once went into the field looking for proof to corroborate the Bible story - now agree that the historic events relating to the stages of the Jewish people's emergence are radically different from what that story tells.

~~~~~~~

Myth of the Exodus

Even this foundational myth of the Jewish religion is riven with invention and inconsistencies:
First of all, there is no evidence of any type that the Israelites were ever slaves in Egypt in the first place. They may have been: a) members of a the Canaanite immigration in advance of the Hyksos invasion of Egypt  (around 1650 BC); b) even Hyksos themselves, since the Hyksos are suspected to have been of Hurrian origin (Abraham’s birthplace). Indeed Josephus identifies the Exodus with Manetho’s report of the emigration of 480,000 Hyksos “shepherd kings” from Egypt to Jerusalem (c 1550 BC). Apion even alleges that the heretic priest Osarseph changed his name to Moses and led a rebellion against Egypt. As archaeologist Jacquetta Hawkes states, “…they were wandering groups of Semites who had long come to Egypt for trade and other peaceful purposes;” or c) perhaps they were opportunistic members (habiru) of the coalition of the Sea Peoples (1200-900 BC), who devastated the Mycenean world until stopped  (and enslaved?) by Egypt.

Second, there is no record of any sort outside of biblical scripture that describes the ten plagues visited upon Egypt. This seems to be pure invention by Exilic scribes in Babylon.

Third, the passage of 603,550 armed men (Numbers 1:46) with wives, children and “a mixed multitude of non-Israelites” would have formed a parade of nearly 2 million, who if marching ten-abreast would form a column 150 miles long through the Sinai desert. Their place of habitation for 38 years after refusing to challenge the Canaanites, Kadesh Barnea, would have been the largest city in the Middle East, yet shows no signs at all of any habitation prior to 1000 BC.

Egyptian Empire 1500-1200 BCE

Fourth, the culture of the earliest Israelite settlements is Canaanite, their cult objects are those of the Canaanite god El (before the adoption of the war god YHWH), the pottery remains are in the Canaanite tradition, and the alphabet used is early Canaanite. Almost the sole marker distinguishing the "Israelite" villages from Canaanite sites is an absence of pig bones.

Fifth, Kings 6:1 maintains that the Exodus occurred 480 years before the construction of Solomon’s Temple: that would be 1450 BC. At that time, not only was Egypt not afraid of a foreign enemy (Pharaoh’s ostensible motive for suppressing the Israelites), but the Israelites would have been escaping from Egypt to … Egypt! Canaan was part of the Egyptian empire (see map) until 1200 BC.

Finally, the widespread use of dromedaries (Exodus 9:3) was not known in Egypt until late in the first millennium BC. Also, at the time of the “invasion” of Canaan by the Israelites, Jericho was not a walled city at all, but was “small, poor, almost insignificant, and unfortified.”

~~~~~~~

Joshua's “conquest” of Canaan

The returning Israelites are instructed by their “god” not to buy land as had Abraham, but rather to invade and obliterate any remnant of the local culture.
Deut 7:2 “And when the Lord thy God shall deliver them before thee; thou shalt smite them, and utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto them:”

Perhaps the most unsettling part of the Exodus myth is that the Post-Exilic priests wrote the legends of early Israelite history in such a savage and chauvinistic tone. One case may serve as an exemplar:
Num 31:1 “And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Numbers-31-2/">2</A> Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites: afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people<A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Numbers-31-3/">.3</A> And Moses spake unto the people, saying, Arm some of yourselves unto the war, and let them go against the Midianites, and avenge the LORD of Midian…. <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Numbers-31-7/">7</A> And they warred against the Midianites, as the LORD commanded Moses; and they slew all the males… <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Numbers-31-9/">9</A> And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives, and their little ones, and took the spoil of all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods. <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Numbers-31-10/">10</A> And they burnt all their cities  wherein they dwelt, and all their goodly castles, with fire. <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Numbers-31-11/">11</A> And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of men and of beasts…

<A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Numbers-31-14/">14</A> And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, with the captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which came from the battle.  <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Numbers-31-15/">15</A> And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive? <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Numbers-31-16/">16</A> Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD.

“Thy will be done.”

 <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Numbers-31-17/">17</A> Now therefore kill every male among the little ones , and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Numbers-31-18/">18</A> But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves  …<A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Numbers-31-35/">35</A> And thirty and two thousand persons in all, of women that had not known man by lying with him… 47Even of the children of Israel's half, Moses took one portion of fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them unto the Levites, which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses…
 51And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even all wrought jewels  …53 For the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.”

Later, in America, the Puritans would see themselves as latter-day Israelites coming into a new Canaan, where “God” (smallpox) had cleared the land before them. They thereupon acted as Joshua had and took over the settlements, killing men, women, and children without mercy. Small wonder ‘patriotic American Christians’ were not upset with the killing of babies at My Lai.

~~~~~~~

Human/Child Sacrifice

It seems the gods of Canaan and likewise YHWH had a taste for blood. Reference to sacrifices:
By neighboring peoples to their gods: Burnt offerings of children are documented to Moloch (Deut 12:31, 2Kings 23:10), the sacrifice of the first-born by Moab (2Kings 3:27)

By Israelites to YHWH: Josiah  burns human bones to YHWH (1Kings 13:1-2, 2Chron 34:1-5), David sacrifices two of Saul’s sons and five of his grandsons to YHWH (2Sam 21:1, 8-14), a town and people are made a burnt offering to YHWH (Deut 13:13-19), YHWH kills all the first-born of Egypt (Ex 13:11-16), YHWH claims all the first-born of Israel as his (Ex 13:2), YHWH hands men over to be ‘fuel for the fire’ (Ez 21:33-37), YHWH demands Isaac be sacrificed (Gen 22:2), a city-full of people is offered as a sacrifice to YHWH (Josh 6:21), a thief is burned to death (Josh 7:15), Jephthah sacrifices his daughter as a burnt offering to YHWH (Judges 11:29-40), every devoted thing - both of man and beast - shall be put to death (Lev 27:28), Moses orders the murder of Midianite women and children (Num 31:25-40), YHWH gives statutes that the first-born are to ‘pass through the fire’ (Ez 20:25-26)

By Israelites to other gods: Ahaz burns his son as an offering (2Kings 16:2-3), Manassah rebuilds altars to Baal and worships foreign gods, as had Ahab (2Kings 21:1-6), Israelites sacrifice their children to Moloch (Ez 16:20-21, 23:37, Is 57:5, Jer 7:31, 19:5, 32:35, Lev 20:2, Ps 106:37-41)

Also note that in all of these legends, the only important character is the male lead; the usually nameless wives and children are mere ciphers: Job’s original family, Lot’s wife, Lot’s daughter, Jephtha’s daughter, King Mesha’s son, Ahaz’s son, Isaac, the Innocents. Human sacrifice is disguised as a necessity, blood sacrifice is preferred (hence god’s preference for the offering of Abel), and of course, Jesus, whose sacrifice is memorialized by a daily cannibalistic ritual. ‘Without the shedding of blood, there is no remission’ (Heb 9:13-22).

Indeed, the deaths of Job’s family are mere collateral damage of a wager between YHWH and Satan:

Job 1:12 <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Job-1-12/">And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Job-1-12/">himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD. 13 And</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Job-1-13/">there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Job-1-13/">brother's house: 14 And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Job-1-14/">the asses feeding beside them: 15 And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Job-1-15/">have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. 16</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Job-1-16/">While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Job-1-16/">heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Job-1-16/">escaped alone to tell thee. 17 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Job-1-17/">Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Job-1-17/">slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. 18 While he</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Job-1-18/">was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Job-1-18/">drinking wine in their eldest brother's house: 19 And, behold, there came a great wind from the</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Job-1-19/">wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Job-1-19/">dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</A>

El, Baal, Asherah, and YHWH (Jehovah)

The earliest ancestor’s of Israel worshipped a god named El (Gen 16:13, 17:1, 21:33, 31:13, 35:7, 11, 43:14, 58:3), El-Elohe-Israel (Gen 33:20), as well as the peace-loving god of vegetation in the Syro-Palestinian pantheon, Baal, and Asherah. The prevalence of their worship is evidenced by the numerous times such altars must be removed. Their altars existed alongside those of YHWH as evidenced by Gideon’s father, Joash, who had altars to Baal and Asherah (Judges 6:25). The fact that Gideon had to destroy his father’s “pagan” altars at night, and was almost executed for his act, further indicates the widespread  acceptance of Baal and Asherah.

YHWH was once viewed as a member of a pantheon ruled over by El. Deut 32:8-9 When the most High (El) divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel. 9. For the LORD’s (YHWH’s) portion is his people: Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.

YHWH seems to have achieved supremacy as Israel’s national god due his military prowess (“YHWH of the Armies”), while in times of peace, Baal would ensure fertility. YHWH, the <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_god">national god</A> of war for both Israel and Judah, seems to have originated in <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edom">Edom</A> and  <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midian">Midian</A> in southern Canaan and may have been brought to Israel by the <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenites">Kenites</A> and <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midianites">Midianites.</A>  Worship of YHWH can be traced back to the time of Moses (Ex 6:3) and seems to be associated with the south of Palestine, for Moses first encounters him in Midian (Ex 18). Further Jael, a Kenite (southern) heroine in YHWH’s wars, is cited in Judg 5:24-30, and Deut 33:2
And he said, The LORD (YHWH) came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto them.

Asherah
Baal

With the emergence of the monarchy, the kings promoted their family god, <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahweh">Y</A>HWH, as the <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henotheism">god of</A>   <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henotheism">the kingdom,</A> but beyond the royal court, religion continued to be polytheistic. The major deities were not numerous - <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_%28god%29">El, Asherah</A> (spouse of El?), YHWH, and <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baal">Baal.</A> At an early stage El and YHWH became fused and Asherah worship ceased as a separate state cult, although she continued to be popular at the local level until Persian times.

The Dubious Priestly Myth of David and Solomon

On editorial license and the legend of David: David raises the heretofore undistinguished Canaanite city of Jerusalem and the Judean Samuelite (Southern) priesthood to their positions of religious dominance, at the expense of Shiloh and the Elide (Northern) priesthood. Solomon cultivates the priests, installing the line of Zadok as High Priests, and so Solomon’s sudden unlineal accession is justified at the expense of the legitimate heir, Adonijah.

The Judean Zadokite priesthood (J) later edit and write the two main works of Israelite history: Genesis to Second Kings (G2K) and Chronicles (Chron), in which David is absolved of any knowledge of or guilt in the deaths of his many enemies: Saul, Abner, Ishbosheth, and Absolom. Indeed, while G2K invents alibis for all David’s numerous improprieties in his rise to power and reign:

that David was serving the Philistine king Achish when Achish’s forces killed Saul;

and the irregularities of David’s reign:

his alliance with Nahash, king of Ammon, enemy of Israel; extermination of Saul’s rightful successor, Ishbosheth, and the rest of Saul’s line; Bathsheba; Absalom; Sheba; Adonijah; and Solomon’s secret, sudden accession.

Chronicles simply ignores them. Chronicles overlaps with parts of G2K, but is a more theologized (pro-Judean) version - stressing the role of Levites, virtually ignoring affairs of the north (Israel), exaggerating numbers, replete with miraculous events, and giving a highly idealized version of David. Legends unique to Chronicles must be approached with caution, and are best viewed as a compendium of purposeful inventions from pro-Davidic Judean sources.

~~~~~~~

The Line of Saul

a Benjamite representative of northern, Israelite interests, challenges the Philistines in the hill country, rules Ephraim, and is supported by Elide priests of Shiloh, leading to conflict with Samuel. Saul is crowned king, offers sacrifice when Samuel is late and for that is blamed by Samuel. David comes to Saul’s court as a soldier, plays his flute for Saul, now portrayed as a solitary paranoiac, and becomes his armor-bearer. David volunteers to Saul to kill Goliath and tries on Saul’s armor. David kills the 9-foot tall Goliath. Samuel orders Saul to “kill all the Amelekites,” but Saul takes Amelikite king Agog prisoner, whom Samuel kills. Samuel condemns Saul a second time for not killing Agog, and claims God has removed his blessing from Saul, so Samuel anoints David, and “the spirit of YHWH” (saving grace) is transferred from Saul to David. Saul’s son Jonathan loves David, and gives him his clothes (sign of abdication to David?). David’s fame as a military hero exceeds that of Saul (1Sam18), so Saul is jealous of David. Saul’s daughter Michal marries David; David flees to Samuel; Saul’s messengers sent to find David all begin prophesying; David flees to Achish, the Philistine king of Gath, where he gathers a rebel army in the service of Achish, whose forces kill Saul and Jonathan at Mount Gilboa, a battle from which David is suspiciously written out. The people of Judah come to Hebron and anoint David, who rules Judah from Hebron for seven years. He carries on good relations with the Philistines, and allies with Nahash, king of Ammon, enemy of Israel (1Sam11, 2Sam10, 17). A long war then ensues between David and the house of Saul (2Sam2)

1000 Ishbosheth is Saul’s rightful heir (and, unfortunately for him, a Northerner). Abner, Saul’s cousin, is the real power behind Ishbosheth. David is at this time allied with the Philistines. Abner accesses Saul’s harem as the first step to taking power, is chastised, begins negotiations with David, comes to David at Hebron, seals the agreement betraying Ishbosheth, and is then and there assassinated by David’s military commander, Joab (David is aghast!) ; then Ishbosheth is assassinated (David is unconsolable!).

1Chronicles - All About Dave

From Adam to Israel - a genealogical list, arranged with Israel last and pointing to its election by God.
The Tribes of Israel - Emphasis on Judah, Benjamin, and Levi: the “loyal” tribes in the schism.
Jabez's Prayer preaches the  “Health-Wealth Gospel,” ignoring care for others and faithful service.
Restored Jerusalem Community  - the crucial link between Chron's community and their past. Saul as an example of unfaithfulness: Chron is only interested in the death of
Saul, who is a foil for David and Solomon, as alterations in the source material make clear.

David as King of All Israel: the lurid aspects in Samuel are largely ignored: the war between Saul and David, his adultery with Bathsheba, his murder of Uriah, the questionable circumstances of Solomon's birth, and the struggle for power between David's sons.

David First Brings the Ark to Jerusalem to establish proper worship, at odds with 2Sam5-6, where David first defeats the Philistines and then rebuilds Jerusalem. After Uzzah's death for touching the ark, David orders that only Levites carry the ark, ascribing a liturgical practice from Chron’s own day to David’s.

God’s Promises that David’s line will always be on the throne of Judah and that of forgiveness to Solomon form the two pillars of the theology of the returning exiles.

David notices Bathsheba

David’s Wars are successful when he trusts God. The Ammonite War is omitted, possibly because of David's adultery with Bathsheba, his murder of her husband, and implied illegitimacy of their progeny, Solomon.

David’s Census at the urging of “Satan” (1Chron 21:1) displeases God and results in severe plagues. So who is "Satan" and why does he incite David? The Hebrew word satan means adversary. In Job and Zechariah, it implies a divine being, though not yet the dualistic personification of Evil of later Judaism and the New Testament, a concept that emerges during the Persian era. It seems best to interpret David's Satan as "a human adversary," perhaps a military threat. But then 2Sam24:1 states, “Again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he incited David against them, saying, 'Go, count the people of Israel and Judah'" Is God’s anger Satan? And what's so wrong with counting the people, anyway? Is it because apportioning Israel for taxation and conscription was a drastic change from long-held beliefs in Israel's tradition, or did David's numbering of the people arise from prideful assumptions about military might that led him away from trust in God?

David has "shed much blood." And so  commissions Solomon as the divinely chosen temple builder.
David authorizes a Temple bureaucracy that only existed in the postexilic period.
David Transfers the Kingdom and Charges Solomon (totally at odds with 1K1-2). There is no controversy over who will be king, no mention of Nathan, Bathsheba, or Adonijah. Solomon has no one killed and does not engage in the palace intrigues that occupy the initial chapters of 1 Kings. The repeated notice is only that God has chosen Solomon to rule Israel and build the temple.

King David

1000 BCE With the murder of Ishbosheth, the path is finally clear for David and his Judean priest Zadok to take over. The elders of Israel come to David and anoint him. David conquers Jerusalem, up to that time a very modest settlement whose name means “founded by Shalem (a Canaanite god)”, and brings the ark of the covenant to Jerusalem (to the resentment of the ten Northern tribes). Nathan pronounces YHWH’s blessing on David’s kingship and promises his dynasty will last forever (2Sam7). David executes Saul’s descendants (2Sam21) and empowers the High Priest Zadok and Levites from Bethlehem, loyal to David, who are scattered throughout the kingdom, a priesthood, not unlike the Jesuits, fiercely loyal to their king. David fights frontier wars with the Philistines, Moabites, Edomites, Ammonites, and Aramaeans. "Zion theology," the idea that the god of Israel has chosen Jerusalem for his dwelling-place and that the <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davidic_dynasty">Davidic dynasty</A> will reign there forever, becomes the state ideology. The House of David rules Jerusalem for four hundred years to 586 BCE. G2K makes an obvious effort to present David in a favorable light, as YHWH’s Chosen One. “House of David” appears in the Tell Dan inscription.
David as the Psalmist? - ledawid, the term based on which the Psalms are attribute to David, likely means not “by David,” but rather dedicated “to David.” David is portrayed chiefly as a musician in Chronicles, though G2K has little on this aspect. The later the version of the story, the more psalms are ascribed to David.

~~~~~~~~

Absolom, Adonijah, and Solomon

0970 BCE The most senior and noble of David’s remaining sons (son of an Aramaean princess from Geshur 2Sam3:3, the only one of David’s sons of royal blood, since Amnon had been killed by him for raping their sister Tamar), Absolom enjoys popular support, rises against David, and David flees Jerusalem, but not before installing his ally Hushai as a disinformant “adviser” to Absalom. Absalom takes over David’s harem (now there’s no turning back). David deploys Ittai and 600 Philistine mercenaries (2Sam15). Hushai discredits Achitophel; Absalom is defeated at Gilead, and is killed by Joab, whom David executes for not dealing “gently” with Absalom. David is restored, then executes all of Saul’s male descendants. The next in line of David’s sons, Adonijah, proclaims himself king (1Kings 1:5-8). Nathan reports Adonijah’s actions to Bathsheba, who convinces the senile David to authorize the crowning of her son, Solomon, in a surprise ceremony orchestrated by Nathan, Zadok and Benaiah (1Kings 1:38-40).

0967-0928 BCE Solomon - Legends are written into Scripture of the Queen of Sheba and Solomon’s reign as a “golden age,” stretching from the Euphrates (?!) to the Egyptian frontier. Solomon is reputed to be wealthy, powerful, and wise.

But is he “wealthy”? Cash flow problems force him to sell twenty cities in Galilee to the Phoenician king of Tyre (1Kings 9:10), and there are no trade items in Solomonic ruins.

Is he “powerful”? He is constantly troubled by Hadad of Edom, Rezin of Damascus, and Jeroboam of Ephraim (1Kings 11:10), his adversaries sent by YHWH “because his wives had turned Solomon’s heart to other gods” (priestly self-justification).

Uxorious Solomon worships a foreign god

Is he “wise”? He used forced labor and other despotic practices that caused the kingdom to break into two immediately after his death (1Kings 12:1). Furthermore, he is not mentioned in any non- Judean sources. Religiously, Solomon had broken the mandate of the <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah">Torah</A> by marrying foreign wives, and worshipping and building shrines to the <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moab">Moabite</A> and <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammon">Ammonite</A> gods (1Kings 11:1-13).

Why then is he so represented? Again, it is because he is credited with building the Temple and establishing the Zadokite sacerdotal ascendancy, so he is a hero to the priests, who later edited and wrote the Scriptures. He succeeds David as king, and forms diplomatic alliances through marriage. He builds the First Temple on Mt. Moriah, which becomes the only acceptable location for sacrifice, thereby granting a religious monopoly to the Zadokites. Chronicles ignores the issue of Solomon’s accession by having David designate him as his successor, and omits all unseemly circumstances, such as the attacks by Hiram of Tyre, Hadad, Rezin, Jeroboam, forced labor, and Ahijah’s prediction that Jeroboam would rule.

~~~~~~~~

Solomon’s successor? The Zadokite Priesthood!

0928 BCE Solomon dies, and simmering conflicts split the country between the northern Ten Tribes: Reuben, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, Asher, Issachar, Zebulun, Joseph (split into Ephraim, Manasseh, and Machir [Manasseh east of the Jordan] ) and the four southern tribes: Judah, Levi (divested of land), Simeon (surrounded and assimilated by Judah), and Benjamin (conquered by Judah in 955). The most divisive issue between Israel (the northern ten) and Judah (the southern four) is the requirement that sacrifice to YHWH be performed exclusively by Zadokite priests at the Temple in Jerusalem. This policy effectively delists Shiloh, the location of the Tent of Meeting (Joshua 18:1), where the Ark of the Covenant had been kept, defrocks its Aaronite priesthood, and constitutes a declaration of religious war.

The Hebrew Scriptures will be written by southern Judean scribes, who demand exclusive Yahwism (no gods but YHWH), and condemn Israel. Jeroboam, the Ephraimite head of Solomon’s forced labor operations, is proclaimed by Ahijah of Shiloh as YHWH’s “next man” (1Kings 11:29), who will become king of the northern tribes; he flees to Egypt until Solomon’s death.

At Solomon’s death, the Assembly at Shechem is convened to crown Rehoboam. Leaders of the ten northern tribes ask Rehoboam if he intends to be as repressive as Solomon; Rehoboam responds that he will be worse: “My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke: my father also chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions." (1Kings 12:14).

The split is justified by the Judean editors of Scripture as punishment for Solomon’s failure to follow priestly exhortations; namely by marrying foreign wives and worshipping foreign gods. (1Kings 11:9-12):

“9. And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned from the Lord God of Israel ... 10 And had commanded him That he should not go after other gods…11.Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom away from thee and will give it to thy servant. 12 Notwithstanding in thy days, I will not do it for David thy father’s sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son."

From Davidic to Divided Kingdom

Ruler in Judah (South)

Ruler in Israel (North)

0927 Jeroboam (927-906) fortifies Shechem, rejects the Royal Zion Theology of the Davidic line designated by prophets, rejects the Jerusalem priesthood by appointing Aaronite non-Zadokite priests, institutes a new cultic calendar, and has annual celebrations at Bethel  (he too ignores the Elide sanctuary at Shiloh), not Jerusalem. Israel in the north, desirous of retaining its traditions, locates its capital at Samaria.  Having a broadly diverse population on the main Syro- Palestinian trade route and thus subject to outside influences, Jeroboam allows worship of Baal, largely to accommodate outsiders; he also builds sanctuaries at Bethel and Dan with golden calves made to the specifications of Aaron’s golden calf to mark the borders. Israelite political life is, however, very unstable: seven kings are assassinated, each time with a regime change; only the lines of Omri and Jehu are able to hold kingship more than two generations.

0926 Rehoboam - In Judah, Rehoboam (926-910), whose mother, Naamah of Ammon, was one of Solomon’s foreign wives, enjoys a 17-year reign. He retains Jerusalem as Judah's capital but in the fifth year of his reign (922), Egyptian pharaoh Shishaq captures all of the fortified towns leading to Jerusalem between Gezer and Gibeon. When he lays siege to Jerusalem, Rehoboam gives Shishaq all the treasures out of the temple as a tribute. The Egyptian campaign cuts off trade with south Arabia via Elath and the Negev established during Solomon's reign, and Judah becomes a vassal state of Egypt. Of course, the priests attribute Shishaq’s invasion to “divine punishment” for Rehoboam’s apostasy (disobedience to the priests).  “Judah did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they committed, more than all that their fathers had done. For they also built for themselves high places (altars to Baal), and pillars, and Asherim on every high hill and under every green tree; and there were also male cult prostitutes in the land. They did according to all the abominations of the nations which the Lord drove out before the people of Israel.” (1Kings 14:22-24) Chron’s agenda here becomes plain: sin brings judgment, obedience brings blessing, and repentance brings deliverance. References in Chron to the north (Israel) are omitted whenever possible. Kings obedient to the priesthood prosper in terms of military victory and wealth through tribute, building projects, rest, and progeny. Disobedient kings experience punishment in the form of military defeat, physical deformity, illness, or untimely death.

0915 Abijah - Chron approves of the obedient Abijah  (though he is condemned in 1K 15:3), whose speech is a list of Chron's themes: David's throne, Solomon's temple, all Israel, and reliance upon God.

0913 Asa - Chron explains Asa’s foreign alliance with Ben-Hadad of Damascus and his diseased feet by dividing Asa into two periods: one of faithfulness and a second of apostasy.

0879 Omri - (879-869) Israel reaches its zenith: when

Israelite king Elah is assassinated by Zimri, Omri’s troops proclaim Omri king (nothing is said of his tribe), and he builds a new capital at Samaria, he marries Jezebel, princess of Sidon, to his son, Ahab. Judah becomes a vassal to the Omrides (1Kgs 22:4). Epigraphical evidence of the Omride Dynasty includes the Mesha Inscription (the Moabite Stone, which relates how the Moabite god Chemosh, angry with his people, delivers them into the hands of Israel, then assists Mesha to liberate Moab). Jehoram of Israel then marshals Judah to reimpose Israelite control (2K3:4- 28); the Tel Dan Stele, which details how Israelite king Jehoram was killed (probably by Hazael, the Aramaean king of Syria); and the Siloam Inscription, which commemorates the completion of a tunnel from Gihon Spring to Siloam Pool. Judah is not documented as a separate state until 733, when Ahaz severs his loyalty to Samaria. Omri subjugates Moab, joins the anti-Assyrian coalition with Syria, reaches the Mediterranean, and allies with Tyre.

0873 Jehoshaphat (870-849) undertakes a maritime venture with Israel because access had been gained to the Gulf of Aqabah. His portrayal in Kings as the nadir of Judean fortunes is starkly different from that in Chron, to whom he is so dear for removing the idols that Chron reads back into Jehoshaphat’s legend the post-exilic separation of civil and sacred law. Chapter 20’s battle account is another roll call of Chron’s themes: Zadokite leadership, retributive justice, reliance upon God, condemnation of foreign alliances, God's rule, and answered prayer.

0868 Ahab (868-850) associates with Phoenicians, marries Jezebel, builds a temple to Baal, and, worst of all, expropriates farmers - becoming thereby very unpopular. The Omride dynasty gains a reputation for economic and social injustice (Naboth Vineyard). The cities - Shechem and Samaria are prosperous and inclusive (Liberal), but the countryside is poor and Yahwist (Fundamentalist). Yahwist prophets’ condemnation of the apostasy of Israel and Jezebel is clearly the work of later pro-Judean compilers who, oversimplifying and exaggerating, project exclusive Yahwism and the primacy of Jerusalem back into earlier times.  Foreign wives are the supposed source of palace apostasy. The Samarian temple to Baal provides foreign traders and diplomats a place to worship, but is a source of competition with exclusive Yahwism, and so must be shunned.  Elijah incites the crowd to murder the prophets of Baal (1Kgs 18:40). Ahab is a co-leader of the anti-Assyrian coalition. The names of Judah and Edom are absent from the list of supporters (perhaps they were subsumed under Israel at the time). There are no archeological remains from the (supposedly grand) Solomonic Jerusalem to equal Ahab’s temple to Baal, or the fortifications of Megiddo, Jezreel, or Hazor.

The Seductress Jezebel (or Cleopatra?)

~0850 Prophetic narratives in conflict: In the Elijah stories: (Widow of Zarephath, The Challenge to Baal, Mount Horeb, The Vineyard of Naboth, Ahaziah, Ascension into Heaven, Elijah as a harbinger of the Messiah in Malachi), Israel is supreme, Baal worship is widespread, Jezebel is the chief villain, and there is conflict with Yahwist prophets. In the Elisha stories (Adoption by Elijah, Elijah’s Ascension, Defeating the Moabites, Killing the Mocking Children, Multiplying the Widow’s Oil, Resurrection of the Child of Shunem, Healing of the Syrian Naaman, Making Iron Float), Israel is weak, Yahwism is strongly supported, Israel is on good terms with Yahwist prophets, and miraculous deeds are performed.  The Ben-Hadad stories (three battles between Syria and Israel) are expanded to give Yahwist prophets center stage, and emphasize Jehoshaphat’s loyalty to YHWH.

Elijah resurrects the son of the Widow of Zarephath

0850 Ahaziah (of Israel) (850-849) Ahab is succeeded by his son Ahaziah, who is refused participation in Jehoshaphat’s maritime venture.

0849 Jehoram (849-842)  Ahaziah (of Israel) dies childless, so Ahab’s sister Athaliah marries Jehoram, son of Jehoshaphat, the two royal families are joined, and Israel and Judah reunite! This is, however, a period of rapid decline for both kingdoms. Jehoram’s Moabite Campaign is retold to give center stage to Elisha, and again emphasize Jehoshaphat’s piety - folk themes with numerous miraculous circumstances, which are ignored in Chron, except to treat of Jehoshaphat, and blame the failure of his maritime venture on cooperation with Israel. Chron deems Jehoram's alliance with Ahab in the north as responsible for his defeat in war, plague, and early death, all which extend into the reigns of Ahaziah and Athaliah. All three are related to Ahab, adopt Ahabic Baalism, die horrible deaths, and are denied burial in the royal cemetery.

0842 Ahaziah (of Judah) is a pawn of his mother, Athaliah, daughter of Ahab and Jezebel and granddaughter of Omri. He is killed either by Jehu (G2K) or Hazael (Tel Dan Stele).

0842 Athaliah is the only non-Davidic ruler, woman, and foreigner to sit upon Judah’s throne. Wife of King Jehoram through a foreign alliance with her father King Ahab of Israel, she takes the throne upon the death of her son Ahaziah, and consolidates her power by assassinating the remaining members of the Davidic line. However, Jehoshabeath, Jehoram's daughter, rescues her infant nephew Joash and hides him in the temple for six years with her husband Jehoiada the priest, thus preserving the Davidic line.

0842 Joash, under the tutelage of Jehoiada the priest, carries out needed temple repairs, but after Jehoiada’s death, Joash lapses into apostasy (contrary to 2K12) and is assassinated in his bed by his servants, a victim of Chron's idea of retributive justice.

Athaliah

0839 Jehu (839-822) The Jehu Dynasty: According to G2K, Jehu, urged on by the prophet Elisha, kills Jehoram and Jezebel, then hosts a “feast” for the prophets of Baal whereat he massacres them, though in the Tel Dan Stele Hazael of Syria claims to have killed Jehoram and Ahaziah (of Judah), so that both Jehu in Samaria and Athaliah in Jerusalem seem to have come to power in the political upheaval caused by Hazael.  Assyria then becomes active again and saves both Israel and Judah from further attacks by Hazael. A problem for the compilers is that YHWH is expected to give victory to those that support him, but Jehu was powerless before Hazael, and Jeroboam II overshadows his Yahwist Judean contemporary Uzziah. Furthermore, the Elisha stories from the Omride period fit the Jehu period better.  Chronicles, on the other hand, completely ignores Israel, gives Levites important roles, and praises pro-Yahwist kings. The prophets Hosea and Amos emerge. During the Jehu Century, Israel and Judah submit to Syria and Assyria (according to the Black Obelisk).

0800 Amaziah also starts off well, but sinks into apostasy (again contrary to 2 Kings 14) by rejecting the word of the prophet, and suffers military defeat and assassination. For Chron, defeat proves guilt.

0788 Jeroboam II (788-748), restores Israel’s borders and participates in the Assyrian economic realm, but as Assyria declines, the wealthy upper class of Israel intensifies its predations on the weak.

0785 Uzziah (785-760) rules Judah under the shadow of Jeroboam II. He remains on good terms with the temple priests for the first part of his reign, but Chron ascribes to him the cultic offense of burning incense (?), punished by leprosy, banishment from the temple, and burial in a field. The prophet Amos is on the spot to point the finger of blame.

0746 Zechariah - Shallum - Menahem (746-738) Zechariah is murdered by Shallum, a captain of his army, who takes the throne, thus ending the Jehu Dynasty. Shallum is then deposed by Menahem, an ally of Assyria, now dominant under Tiglath-Pileser.

0742 Jotham is a refreshing model of obedience and blessing. 0735 Ahaz - Chron has Judah sinking to its lowest point under Ahaz (according to G 2K, it was under Manasseh), because he worships foreign gods, and stops the sacrifices in the temple. In Chron, bad kings (Ahaz, Manasseh) alternate with good kings (Hezekiah, Josiah). Ahaz sacrifices a son (2K16:3) to Moloch to lift the Syro-Ephraimite siege of Jerusalem, as had the Moabite king Mesha on an earlier occasion. Ahaz, supervised by the priest Uriah without protest (2K16:10), constructs a Syrian altar, then is forced to abdicate because of health (in Chron because he worships Syrian gods). Isaiah encourages Ahaz to continue his pro-Assyrian policies, but he is hard-pressed by Rezin of Syria, the Edomites, Israelite King Pekah, and the Philistines to join the anti-Assyrian block (denounced by Micah). Isaiah supports defending Jerusalem, and letting YHWH handle the rest. In 0 734, the Assyrians return to the relief of Judea, and suppress Rezin. Ahaz, now independent of Israel, pays tribute to Tiglath-Pileser.

0734 Pekah (734-31) kills Pekakiah, and with support from Rezin, takes over part of Israel, now called Ephraim. To get Judah to join their anti-Assyrian coalition, they then attack Jerusalem, as recorded in Isaiah 7-8. Pekah is killed, and Hoshea becomes an Assyrian vassal.

Ahaz Sacrificing his Son

0732 Hoshea (732-722) Egypt’s 25th</span><span class="cls_003"> Dynasty becomes a</span></div competitor with Assyria for dominance in the Middle East. Israelite King Hoshea buys in to the Egyptian propaganda and ceases tribute payments to Assyria. When Assyria attacks Israel, the Egyptians do not come to his aid, and Israel falls. G2K predictably blames Israel’s apostasy and failure to heed prophets for its fall. Many people are deported from Israel to Assyria and replaced with settlers from other parts of the Assyrian empire - such population exchanges were an established part of Assyrian imperial policy, a means of breaking the old power structure. The captives in Assyria are split up, quickly assimilate, and thus ten of the twelve tribes disappear.  Judah remains loyal to Assyria (for the moment) and survives as an Assyrian vassal.

Fall of Samaria

0727 Hezekiah (727-699) Judah recovers with much biblical glorification in G2K and Isaiah. Samaria is taken by the Assyrians, and Isaiah advises Hezekiah, king of Judah in the South, to capitulate. The Assyrians surround Jerusalem, but are mysteriously killed (plague?), and Jerusalem is saved for now. Hezekiah shows the state treasures to Merodach-baladan of Babylon, and Isaiah predicts he (Hezekiah) will be carried into Babylon.  In Chron, Levites purify the temple, reinstate proper worship, and destroy local shrines; the people bring tithes, and Hezekiah and Isaiah pray together. Hezekiah grows ill because of his pride, but humbles himself, and gets better; Jerusalem is spared. Back in the real world, Sargon dies, and revolt in Assyrian lands spreads. Isaiah: I told you that Assyria was a temporary power; Hezekiah revolts; Sennacherib invades and devastates the countryside, but can’t take Jerusalem (partly due to the Siloam water tunnel). When Israel falls to Assyria (0722), Hezekiah invites the Northerners to a renewed celebration of the Passover, and, according to Chron, defends Jerusalem against Sennacherib's invading army through prayer. Overlooked by Chron are Hezekiah's surrender to Sennacherib, his trust in foreign alliances, the stripping of the temple, and Isaiah's rebuke. Judah becomes an Assyrian client state controlling the valuable olive industry.

0700 Universal dominion of YHWH is asserted by Tobit, a Naphthalian captive in 722, who preaches that the diaspora is good since it spreads worship of YHWH, and Isaiah who maintains YHWH has empowered the Assyrians and Babylonians in order to punish Israel. Isaiah also attacks corrupt officials who oppress the poor.

0698 Manasseh (698-644) is Judah's worst king, according to G2Kings: worse than Ahaz since he allowed non- Yahwist altars (as a quid pro quo for access to Assyria’s export markets?), though his reign of 55 years is the longest in Israel or Judah. He inherits a war-torn country, yet with Assyrian power now at its acme, Judah prospers.

0642 Amon  undoes all the reforms of his repentant father, Manasseh. He is assassinated.

0641 Josiah (641-610) (8 years old) is put on the throne by Judean aristocrats.  High priest Hilkiah “discovers” the Book of Deuteronomy, which contains a frightening assessment of the fate due to Judah for her sins of tolerating other faiths. Josiah then murders all agents of alien faiths (and sodomites) and destroys their sanctuaries in a rampage that puts Kristallnacht to shame. He reinstitutes Passover and then dies in an encounter with Pharoah Neco. In Kings no mention is made of a message from YHWH communicated by Neko (an odd choice for a messenger). The fact that in spite of his pious actions, YHWH will still punish Judah for the sins of Manasseh indicates that the legend was written after the fall of Judah. Further, the many forms of non-Yahwist idolatry which he suppresses are testimony to the continuous, widespread acceptance of Baal, Asherah and others in Judah in the 300 years since Solomon. Chron’s account of Josiah has the precocious child tearing down altars at twelve years of age, even before Deuteronomy is found. Pharaoh Neco arrives, having been sent by YHWH (?!), and warns Josiah to stay out of his way. Neko fails to do so and is killed. Jeremiah makes a cameo appearance lamenting his death.

0630 Assyrian power collapses; now the competition is between Egypt and Babylonia

Josiah Hearing the Book of the Law

0627-585 Jeremiah: ‘We should prosper in Babylon and pray for local government while caring about Jerusalem.’

0612 Period of Babylonian Domination - Babylonians overrun the Assyrian capital, Nineveh.

0609 Pharoah Neco leads the Egyptian and Assyrian armies out to confront the Babylonians; Josiah inexplicably comes out to confront him and is killed at Megiddo.

Jeremiah, the Weeping Prophet

0609 Jehoahaz-Jehoiakim - In the difficult geopolitical situation that accompanied the decline of Assyrian hegemony, Egypt and Babylon are both vying for power. In 609 BCE, the Egyptians, hoping to bolster the crumbling Assyrians in the face of Babylonian aggression, kill Josiah, depose his son Jehoahaz, and install Jehoiakim (608-598) as a puppet king. In 605, Nebuchadnezzar defeats Egypt at Carchemish and solidifies Babylon's supremacy. Jeremiah, supported by high-ranking family and officials, endorses submission to Babylon and gives his famous temple sermon that the Jerusalem temple, like that of Shiloh, is to be destroyed. Jeremiah is thereafter barred from entering the temple.

0598 An anti-Babylonian meeting, opposed by Jeremiah but supported by the people, is held in Jerusalem including Judah, Moab, Ammon, Tyre, and Sidon. Jehoiakim decides to withhold tribute from Babylon, and to ally with a more assertive Egypt, though Pharoah Neco is only interested in access to the sea and will abandon Judah. Nebuchadrezzar captures Jerusalem (the first time), as Jehoiakim dies waiting for Egyptian help.

0598 Jehoiachin - Zedekiah - Jehoiakim’s son Jehoiachin is captured and led to Babylon with Ezekiel and leading citizens in the first Babylonian captivity. Zedekiah is placed on the throne by the Babylonians.

0587 Nebuchadrezzar has not been around for awhile, and Egypt defeats Nubia, so Zedekiah rebels. Jerusalem is besieged, and when Jeremiah predicts YHWH will fight for Babylon, he is put in the stocks. This time, Egypt sends an army that briefly lifts the siege, but finally loses interest and the siege is reimposed. Zedekiah is taken before Nebuchadrezzar: his sons are killed before him, he is then blinded and taken to Babylon. Jerusalem is conquered (the second time) by Babylon, the Temple is destroyed, and leading families are forcibly moved to Babylon (Second Babylonian Captivity). The destruction of Jerusalem, its Temple, and the Davidic dynasty by Babylon is deeply traumatic. Prophets and Deuteronomist priests will claim vindication of prophecies (to be written later in Babylon), and blame the fall of the state on apostasy rather than YHWH’s weakness. G2K is written to explain to a Judah in Babylon why they were exiled; Chron is written to the returned community, explaining Jeremiah's announcement that the exile would last seventy years, a mere interlude  to allow the land to enjoy its neglected Sabbaths.

~~~~~~~~

Babylonian Rule

The reign of Gedaliah, a non-Davidic ruler appointed by Nebuchadrezzar, is suppressed by the biblical compilers. Ishmael, a Davidic claimant, assassinates Gedaliah, but is opposed by Judean officials, and so flees to Egypt, taking Jeremiah. The third Babylonian deportation then ensues. G2K and Chron are silent as to Judah after the fall, but Jeremiah, Ezekiel and Deutero-Isaiah 40-55 document the state of affairs. Aramaic becomes the dominant spoken language. Deutero-Isaiah asserts the first truly Hebrew monotheism by asserting that gods other than YHWH are impotent idols;

There is also an Egyptian diaspora: the Elephantine military colony assimilates with Egyptians, but keeps contact with Jerusalem and Samaria, and has a temple for syncretic worship condemned by Jeremiah

Evolution of Theodice: why do bad things happen to good people?

Job Rebuked by his Friends

0550 The Book of Job is written with its fascinating Theodice and portrayal of Satan as opposing counsel chatting with the LORD and cajoling Him into destroying the life of Job.

Evolution of Theodice: why do bad things happen to good people?
1. Free will - It’s not God's fault; you somehow deserve it. Asked why God allows cruelty against children, Pope Francis responded that people have free will; interestingly, the abuser has free will, not the abused.
2. Redemptive - God tests us to find the limits of our faith.
3. Mystery - It's all part of the plan that you can’t understand.
4. Divine love - God punishes those he loves. (My favorite)
5. Deuteronomistic - Group punishment for the sin of one/a few; namely, the failure of a ruler to obey God (as interpreted by priests) - a theory devised by … priests!
6. Apocalyptic - The Zoroastrian (Persian) idea that the world is dualistic - either good or evil - and that now, since no other theory seems valid, it is dominated by evil. But suffering will be vanquished at the end of time, when the Davidic Messiah will expel the strangers, resurrect the dead, reward the good, punish the evil, and rule in righteousness until Judgment Day. (Don’t hold your breath.)

~~~~~~~~

The Persian Era

0539 Cyrus II captures Babylon - The Persian era will last until Alexander in 0332. Under Persia, the exiles are allowed to return from Babylon, rebuild the temple with the Zadokite High Priest as ruler, though many exiles stay in Babylon. The Persian era lays the foundations for the unified Judaic religion and the beginning of a scriptural canon.  The Davidic Zerubbabel is appointed Governor of Yehud, exciting Messianic hopes. Zecheriah: ‘He is chosen by god, redemption is imminent,’ and so he is relieved of his duties (and killed?) by the Persians.

0515 The <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Temple_period">Second Temple is consecrated. The period</A> is characterized by strict <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotheism">monotheism,</A> the emergence of beliefs regarding <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel">angels</A> and <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon">demons,</A> and the increasingly important institution of the synagogue. Yehud becomes a theocracy ruled by hereditary high priests, with a Persian-appointed governor, frequently Jewish, charged with keeping order and seeing that taxes are paid. The city is refortified, and Judean life is reformed. Biblical sources focus almost exclusively on highly Yahwistic exilic returnees, with no information on returnees before Nehemiah: it may have been more desirable to stay in Babylon, as Josephus relates, many were “unwilling to leave their property.”

0445 Nehemiah, Cupbearer to the Persian King, with the status of a Persian royal governor, on the order of Artaxerxes executes Jewish law, rebuilds the walls of Jerusalem, and demands a pure genealogy from those who wish to worship at the Temple. He brings strict Yahwism based on Deuteronomy, restores the Levites, enforces the Sabbath, and demands that foreign wives and children be sent away: Judaism is born, along with the Samaritan schism. Nehemiah also alleviates the exploitation of the poor, who were selling family members into slavery and were paying usurious interest on loans made contrary to the law, then he returns to Persian court to defend himself.These returnees, though they waited nearly one hundred years to leave Babylon, bear great disdain for those who stayed in Yehud, based partly on the exclusivism that the exiles developed while in Babylon and also partly on disputes over property.  But wait! Didn’t Nehemiah rule after Ezra? Not according to the times in office of the high priests: Eliashib under Nehemiah (Neh 3:1,20; 13:4), and Jehohanan under Ezra (10:6).

Nehemiah Rebuilds the Walls of Jerusalem

0407 Jews of Elephantine (Egypt) appeal for help rebuilding their temple, but are denied.

0398 Ezra, part of the Babylonian Revival, returns to Jerusalem, has the Torah read. Under Ezra, Judaism becomes a religion of the book, with reading as important as sacrifice as an act of worship. Ezra may have been the first ‘rabbi,’ though he preached neither end of days, nor Davidic preference, nor blatant nationalism.

0350 Chron  rewrites Biblical stories strongly to David’s advantage.

0340  Samarian leader Sanbalat supports Alexander against Persia; Alexander is victorious, and so the Samaritan Joseph tribes (Manassah, Ephraim) are allowed to build a Temple on Mt. Gorizim (Nablus). Greek culture spreads with Alexander’s victory over Persia.

~~~~~~~~

Alexander and Hellenism

0332 <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great">Alexander the Great</A> conquers Persia. On Alexander’s death in 323, his general Seleucus takes the Fertile Crescent, and Ptolemy takes Egypt. Similarities between Jesus and Alexander: divine adoption, dual divine- human parentage, virgin birth, universal transformative mission, death at 33, deification. Conquest of the Holy Land by yet another foreign power in spite of the piety of the state (barring foreign wives and foreign gods), leads to a rejection of the Deuteronomist view and the emergence of Messianic Apocalypticism in the prophet Daniel.

Alexander in the Temple of Jerusalem

Alexander brings a flood of new settlers into the area, creating a new political-social reality - Hellenism: Greek becomes the lingua franca; a new scientific, literary and legal environment emerges; the personal philosophy of Stoicism helps individuals to cope with a confused social reality; religious syncretism becomes the basis of the dominant common culture among the upper classes of these regions until Islam in the 7th</span><span class="cls_003"> century CE. Universalism</span></div (peaceful coexistence) is the new standard, but is emphatically rejected by Yahwistic Jews, who are portrayed by the civilized world as misanthropic and inhumane. Jews’ refusal to worship the Emperor, and their habit of sending money to Jerusalem mark them for suspicion as a fifth column.

0301 <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_I">Ptolemy I</A> of Egypt takes Jerusalem (<A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yehud_Medinata">Yehud Medinata</A>) by attacking on the Sabbath.

Maccabees oppose Antiochus IV

0300 Traditionalists vs. Hellenizers: A prolonged internal struggle begins, manifest early in disputes over the calendar. The common core of Judaism is determined: God as an active element in history, the Torah, support for the Temple, establishment of synagogues, dietary laws, circumcision, the Sabbath, exclusive Yahwism.

~~~~~~~~

Synagogues and Rabbis

0250 1 Enoch is written, of which an Ethiopic text is later found at Qumran. Themes include for the first time many of the accoutrements of later Christian belief: a solar calendar, angels, heaven and hell, Son of Man existent before creation, judgment after death, resurrection of believers - ideas also reflected in Daniel 12:2.

0230 Synagogues: Though perhaps mentioned by Ezekiel “I will be a comfort to them,” and though Ezra led readings of the Torah, congregational meetings are not regular until the first synagogue, most likely the proseuche - prayer (venue) begun in Egypt during the reign of Ptolemy III, at which meetings there are a priest and an elder (rabbi), where diaspora communities gather to read the Torah under a leader (Acts). Synagogues will not be introduced to Judea until 0070 CE. Access to God is no longer the exclusive prerogative of the priests.

0200 Sadducees (“descendants of Zadok”) believe that people have total free will, that there is no after life (like Epicureans, though here an outgrowth of the Zadokite teaching that one should serve God as though no wage - Heaven - were paid), that written tradition can come only from Moses, that ‘legitimate’ priests must take back their rights from the Hasmoneans. Sadducees are, however, wealthy and alienated from the common people.

0200 Pharisees (Aramaic “separated ones”) believe that some things are determined by fate and others by will, so divine reward/punishment are deserved since we are somewhat responsible. Why then is there no justice? There must be justice in an afterworld - similar to Stoicism, and the oral tradition from Moses, the first “rabbi”; the message attracts the lower classes (quite close to that of the Christians, so the conflict between Pharisees and Christians will be so bitter). Because of their affinity to the masses, they are authorized to determine Temple practices for Sadducees.

~~~~~~~~

The Septuagint (LXX)

Greek-speaking Jews need a translation of the Bible into Greek, the Septuagint, in which certain liberties are taken: themes of the after-life are introduced; Proverbs is translated very freely; certain factual inconsistencies emerge: the enemies of Israel, who had been Aramaeans and Philistines are now Syrians and coastal Greek cities; words assume new meanings; there is a reluctance to refer to anthropomorphism - in Isaiah 38:11 ‘the Lord’ becomes ‘salvation,’ Exodus 24:10 ‘the Lord’ becomes ‘the place’; mistakes abound: Isaiah 7:14 ‘alma - young woman’ becomes ‘parthenos - virgin.’ This one error alone leads to millennia of creative theologizing). Some Jewish scholars contend that only the Pentateuch is translated under divine guidance, hence only those translations are accurate.

One egregious example of rampant translation error is Isaiah Chapter Three, in which there are 41 translation errors. I have highlighted only a few verses below. My favorite is ‘transparent Spartan dresses’ for ‘crisping pins.’

The format below is:   Hebrew Masoretic Text, King James Version (generally correct), Septuagint (often errant), Septuagint in English

Isaiah Chapter Three
כ הַפְּ אֵ רִ ים וְּ הַצְּ עָדֹות וְּ הַקִ שֻּׁרִ ים ּובָתֵ י הַנֶּפֶּׁש וְּ הַלְּחָ ׁשִ ים

 23 and those made of fine linen, and the purple [ones], and the scarlet [ones], and the fine linen, interwoven with gold and purple, and the light coverings for couches. (six items)

~~~~~~~~

Emergence of Messianic Apocalyticism

0200 Messianism independent of Apocalypticism emerges. The Machabees avoid references to Messianism because they are not Davidic, but were usurpers. Messianism is intended to be restorative, directed inward, and in accord with natural laws. Sometimes theory has two Messiahs: a king and a priest, Moses and Aaron. Apocalypticism is, on the other hand, utopian, eschatological, directed outward, supernatural, not necessarily Messianic; the Messiah would gather the banished Is 11:12.

Participatory Messianism

0198 Antiochus III (Seleucid) takes Jerusalem after a siege, then allows the Jews to remain largely self-governing. Ethics are to be governed by ancestral laws; Jewish elites align with the foreign occupiers (again).

0189 The Seleucids are defeated by Rome at Magnesia. Yet another foreign invader is at the door.

0187-0175 Seleucus IV succeeds Antiochus, and loots the Jerusalem temple to pay reparations to Rome. Good relations with the Jewish aristocracy are harmed. Hellenization is widespread among the upper classes, as indicated by the prevalence of Greek names. Religious and social conservatives conflict with Hellenizers.

0186 In order to unite his ruled territories, Antiochus III imposes paganism on the Jews. 0180 Joshuah Ben Sirach cites the Torah and Prophets as the Jewish canon to which, once definitively established, no new works can be added.

0176 The Heliodorus Affair - High Priest Onius III is accused by a certain Simon of under-reporting tax income to the Seleucids; Heliodorus is sent by Antiochus III to Jerusalem and conducts an audit; Onius III goes to the Seleucid capital of Antioch to make his case; Antiochus III is assassinated; Antiochus IV takes over.

0175 Antiochus IV Epiphanes. The position of Jewish High Priest is bought by a certain Jason, who then Hellenizes Jerusalem and renames the city Antioch in honor of Antiochus IV.

0172 High Priest Jason is replaced by Menelaus, a far more radical Hellenizer, who seeks to bring Jews into the mainstream of Greek social and political life.

0168 Antiochus invades Egypt to achieve his dream of a united Hellenist East. At the gates of Alexandria he is ordered to withdraw by the Roman ambassador, Gaius Popillius Laenas. Antiochus says he must think about it, upon which Laenas draws a line in the sand around Antiochus and replies, “You’ll think about it here!” Antiochus withdraws and rumors are spread that he has died. Conservatives in Jerusalem depose Menelaus and undo the Hellenizing reforms. Antiochus isn’t dead, suppresses the revolt brutally, brings a Greek garrison into Jerusalem, introduces pagan rites into the Temple, and outlaws Jewish customs. Jewish martyrs arise: Mattathias (Hasmonean) refuses to worship the Greek gods, and sparks a revolt in Jerusalem. His son, Judah Machabee (the Hammer) leads a guerrilla war against the Seleucids.

~~~~~~~~

The Machabees

0167 Judah Machabee besieges the Greek garrison in Jerusalem

0167 The Book of Daniel is composed and written back into the days of the Babylonian captivity. Continued domination by a parade of foreign powers in spite of the piety of the priests and people discredits the Deuteronomist view and heralds the emergence of Apocalypticism. The characteristics of apocalyptic works are: pseudonymity - visions are attributed to figures from the past; numerical symbolism; secret language - contemporary rulers referred to by past rulers; animal symbolism; doctrine of angels; division of history into periods (of which the Greek is the fourth and final); references to the coming time; and belief in one or more Messiahs who would deliver Israel from foreign domination (a point conveniently overlooked by Christians).

0164 The Machabean rebels are victorious. Jonathan Machabee becomes High Priest, though he is not a Zadokite, and purifies the Temple - the origin of Hanukkah. The Zadokites then evolve into 1) the Egyptian Leontopolis cult under Onius IV, 2) Jerusalem’s Sadducees, and 3) the Essenes of the Qumran sect. Some see this period also as a civil war between orthodox and <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_Judaism">Hellenized Jews.</A> Hasmonean kings attempt to revive the Judah described in the Bible: a Jewish monarchy ruling from Jerusalem over all territories once ruled by David and Solomon. In order to carry out this project, the <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasmonean">Hasmoneans</A> forcibly convert Moabites, Edomites, and Ammonites, as well as the lost kingdom of Israel (Samaritans) to Judaism.

Antiochus seeks to eradicate the Jewish Religion

0161 Judah Machabee renews the treaty with Rome to weaken Hellenism; Jews assert their nationalism.

0150 Testaments of the Patriarchs - a text is written of ‘the speeches that should have been made.’ Levi and Judah are associated as dual Messiah figures.

0150 Jubilees - a text retelling stories within a framework of seven years, with the use of a solar calendar, written in Ethiopic, containing many historical anachronisms and talking animals.

0142 The Seleucids free Hasmonean Judea from paying taxes to the Empire. The Machabees are recognized as a new dynasty “until a new prophet shall arise,” … or the Romans (63 BCE).

0134-0104 John Horchanus I succeeds his father Simon Machabee. Besieged in Jerusalem by the Seleucid Antiochus VII, he first removes, then readmits non-combatants. The walls of Jerusalem are broken down. After the death of Antiochus VII, the Seleucid Empire begins to break up. Horchanus robs the Tomb of David to support a mercenary army, by which he expands his kingdom (Idumea), destroys the (schismatic) Samaritan temple (111 BCE), and forces conversions of non-Jewish populations, among whom is the grandfather of Herod the Great.

0130 1 Machabees in Hebrew relates Jewish history 175-135 BCE. Mattathias, like Phineas in Numbers, gives legitimacy to Hasmoneans.

0120 2 Machabees in Greek relates the ideology of martyrdom, resurrection, Judaism, Hellenism, and how Jews can live in the diaspora.

~~~~~~~~

The Essenes: (the Dead Sea Scroll sect?)

0120 believe that all is decided by fate (no free will). They separate themselves from the vulgar, impure priesthood and people, and bear many similarities to Christians: baptism, contemporizing prophecies, solar calendar, communal organization, Messianic vocabulary, apocalypticism, predestination, and dualism. They avoid the corrupt city and expect a Davidic Messiah and a future world (Daniel) in which the Davidic monarchy is guaranteed forever (Is 11:6, Jeremiah 23, Zechariah).  Then God’s wrath will cease and He will establish a new covenant with them alone. The Dead Sea Scrolls: The War Scroll - in a final battle, setbacks are to be expected, but God’s intervention will be decisive. Pesher are texts with contemporary interpolation of prophecies. The sect goes extinct after the Fall of Jerusalem (70 CE).

0104-0103 Aristobolus I conquers Galilee, forces conversion to Judaism of Galileans.

0103-0076 Alexander Jannaeus (Greek name) defeats a rebellion, banquets as the rebels’ wives and children of the rebels are killed in front of the crucified rebels. The Hasmoneans have themselves become thoroughly Hellenized.

0076 Salome Alexandra, wife of Alexander, becomes regent and empowers the Pharisees against the Saducees, whom she removes from Jerusalem.

0067 Hasmonean Civil War: Alexandra dies and her two sons Hyrcanus II and Aristobolus II both seek Roman help. The two trade titles as the Romans solidify their rule over Judea.

0066 Rebellion: Cataclysm is imminent: should zealots themselves light the fuse (Pharisees) or will all happen according to the Divine Plan (Sadducees)? Ethnic and social tensions erupt (some burn debt records); Rome aids its allies, the aristocrats. After initial successes for the rebels, Vespasian isolates Jerusalem. Yohanan ben Zakkai escapes in a coffin, meets Vespasian, predicts his kingship. Vespasian is pleased, and asks what ben Zakkai wants, to which he replies “Give me only Yavne (anachronistic, the town was not yet built) and its wise men (not the priests?!).” Ben Zakkai establishes the first synagogue in Judea, citing Moses as the first rabbi.

Mattathias Slays an Idolater

~~~~~~~~

Roman Period

0063 The Roman general Pompey conquers this last nominally independent kingdom of <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judea">Judea.</A>

0048 Pompey is defeated by Julius Caesar in 48, and Antipater of Edom becomes the first Roman Procurator.

0045 Jews refuse to assimilate. Jewish law tries to separate Jews from gentiles to prevent Jews from adopting idolatrous behaviors. In Jewish law, a gentile is grouped together with dishonest butchers, gamblers, usurers and thieves who cannot act as witnesses; and charity from non-Jews is not to be accepted. Dietary laws also limit social interactions; e.g., food cooked by non-Jews is prohibited; hence, Shakespeare’s Shylock: “I will not eat with you.”

0044 Caesar is assassinated and Quintus Labienus, Roman general and ambassador to the Parthians (Persians), sides with the Liberators (Caesar’s assassins), and assists the Parthians in invading Roman territories.

0040 Parthians overrun Syria and Palestine and empower Antigonus. Herod (son of Antipater) goes to Rome, befriends Marc Antony, and is declared King of the Jews by the Roman Senate.

0037 Herod the Great expels the Parthians, retakes Judea, eliminates the Hasmoneans, and installs a Babylonian as High Priest. Alexandra, the mother of his Hasmonean wife Mariomne, is upset, so she contacts Cleopatra VII to have Marc Antony appoint her son, Aristobulus III, as High Priest. He is appointed, and is enthusiastically supported by the people, but Herod feels threatened, and so kills Aristobulus.

0031 The Battle of Actium. Octavian defeats Marc Antony and Cleopatra VII; Herod meets with Octavian, convinces Octavian to keep him as king, and executes a brutal repression. He kills his beloved wife Meriomne, her mother Alexandra, and Meriomne’s Hasmonean sons. This, or the example of Alexander Jannaeus, is likely the inspiration for the tale of the Holy Innocents. Herod further fills Jerusalem with Hellenistic architecture, expands the Temple, and brings in diaspora priests.

Herod greets the Three Kings

0004 BCE Herod the Great dies, leaving three sons, all named Herod: 1) Herod Archelaus succeeds his father as ruler in Judea, Idumea, and Samaria. 2) Herod Philip rules Golan, marries Herodias, lives until 34; 3) Herod Antipas rules in Galilee and Parea until 39, marries Herodias (his late brother Philip’s widow), and executes John the Baptist. Jesus is born.

Common Era (AD)

0006 Herod Archelaus is judged incompetent and is removed as the last <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnarch">ethnarch.</A>  ; a Roman prefect (later Pontius Pilate) is brought in. Quirinius, Governor of Syria, assesses property for taxation purposes (the ‘census’ in Luke). The territories of Judea are combined with those of <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idumea">Idumea</A> and <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaria">Samaria</A> and governed as Judaea Province under direct <A HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_empire">Roman</A> administration. The government is moved to Caesarea Maritima, which has better communications. Organized resistance to Rome begins: Judah of Gamila and Zadok the Pharisee (proponent of the Fourth Philosophy) preach that ‘subservience to Rome is idolatry.’

~~~~~~~~

John and Jesus

0025 John the Baptist, an Apocalyptic preacher, feeds the hopes of Apocalyptic Jews who are expecting a human Messiah descended from David to rule over an independent restored kingdom of Israel.

0029 Herod Antipas marries Herodias (who had divorced his brother Philip), and executes John the Baptist, either because he objected to Antipas’ marriage to Herodias, or because John was an eloquent revolutionary, fond of quoting Is 40:3 “prepare the way.”

0030 Ministry of Jesus - (See Part Two for a discussion of the criteria used to ferret out the “Historical Jesus.”) Jesus is born in Nazareth (a backward village so insignificant it is not mentioned once in the Hebrew Scriptures or Josephus) to Mary and Joseph (Joseph is never heard from again) around 4 BC, and had siblings - both brothers (James et al), and sisters (Mk 3:31). He is born and raised as a Jew, in an area of Galilee that had been forcibly converted to Judaism by Aristobolus I in 104 BCE.

Jesus was most probably trained to be a tekton - carpenter, or construction worker of some sort, and seems to have been drawn to the apocalyptic teaching of his “cousin” (Luke 1:36), John the Baptist. Beginning with his baptism by John, Jesus taught an Apocalyptic message.

In Matthew, Jesus’ first recorded preaching (4:17 Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.) is a direct quote from John and Jesus seems to have been guided into thinking of himself as the Messiah by his desire to fulfill John’s expectations.He began his ministry in his native Galilee, but was not well received either by his family (Mk 3:21,31, John 7:5, Paul 1Cor 15) or the neighboring towns of Galilee (Mk 6:1, Lk 4, L 10, M 11). Though the chief Galilean cities of Cepherus and Tiberius were within walking distance, Jesus is never recorded as having gone there. He is a prophet without honor (Mk, John, Thomas), who had no home (Mk 8, Lk 9, John 15:18). Much in the mold of Isaiah, he shares John’s contempt for the Pharisees (Jews who emphasize minute adherence to the letter rather than the spirit of the Law) and Sadducees (“smug” priests of the Temple in Jerusalem and collaborators with Rome), and is concerned for the long-suffering multitudes.

He goes to Jerusalem at Passover apparently to cement his reputation as a prophet and to make his theological points, perhaps even to incite an armed uprising. He overturns the tables of money-changers and, as intended, attracts the unfavorable attention of the Jewish authorities by disrupting Temple activities and preaching the imminent arrival of the apocalyptic Kingdom of Heaven.

He is betrayed by his disciple Judas, who likely tells the Roman authorities that Jesus is claiming to be the Messiah and future ruler of Palestine. He is arrested (while with his band of armed “zealots”), tried by Pontius Pilate, crucified, and probably dies on the cross, though Josephus tells of two men who survived crucifixion. Details of his death are inconsistent (see notes below on Matthew 28). As for his “resurrection,” he is most likely buried in a mass grave, as was the usual Roman custom for those guilty of treason.

~~~~~~~~

Jesus’ Teachings

are best summarized by the Sermon on the Mount with the Beatitudes and Antitheses:

Jesus on love: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself,’ a sentiment already present in Leviticus. Also, in stark contrast to Nahum 1:2 ‘The lord takes vengeance on his adversaries (Gentiles) and rages against his enemies,’ and the beliefs of the Qumran sect that one should love certain people (our sect), hate everyone else (even Jews), Jesus proposes loving one’s enemies.

Jesus also broke with convention by consciously associating with women and repentant sinners rather than with the proudly self-righteous; he preferred the attitude of sinful humility to that of smug spiritual superiority.

Regarding salvation, Matthew 25, discussed in greater detail below, is Jesus’ clearest doctrinal pronouncement. With its unambiguous endorsement of “works,” it directly contradicts later Pauline emphasis on “faith.”

Jesus was doubtless an Apocalypticist. The earliest sources - Q, Mark, M, Lk, and Paul - are all apocalyptic (cf, 1Enoch 69, Dan 7:13ff, Paul 1Cor 15:23, 1Thess 4:16ff, Mk 1:15, 8:38, 9:1!, 13:24ff, 13:30!, 14:62, Matthew 25:13; 19:28! (twelve thrones), Luke 17:24, 12:40). Apocalypticism was a widespread philosophical school in 1st</span><span class="cls_003"> century</span></div Palestine, which asserted that: the world is clearly divided between the powers of good and evil, that they then lived in an age of evil, that nothing can save the world except the direct intervention of God, that God’s intervention is imminent (Mk 9:1), that the beginning of God’s intervention will be signaled by resurrection of the good who suffered and the evil who inflicted suffering to face judgment. After it becomes evident that the Coming is not imminent, the message is changed: Mark 9:1 was toned down to Lk17:20. Then John 11:23 modifies it even further, saying that resurrection occurs whenever one had faith.

~~~~~~~~

Reaction to the Crucifixion

0033 After Jesus' sudden and shocking death, his followers spread his message and embellish or invent stories of his life. Our challenge is to separate the aspects of this remarkable life which are more likely to be historical from those that are not. Especially suspect are stories that feature angels, dreams, miracles, predictions of the future, and fulfillment of prophecies. Sometimes actual stories are embellished with miraculous features. Healing the sick and raising the dead may be examples of this. It is possible that people experienced a placebo effect merely from the touch of the holy man, similar to the effect of the Elder Zossima in Brothers Karamazov or the effect of Caesar's presence upon his soldiers as described in Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. It is also possible that Jesus mastered some of the magical tricks of the prophetic trade and impressed the mobs as can Penn and Teller. It is important to note that magic was a staple of the period and even Simon Magus was seen flying in the book of Acts. It is likewise no wonder that believers whose fundamental faith is based upon a miracle (the Resurrection) should have no qualms about mythologizing the life of their leader. After his death, convinced, in spite of overwhelming evidence to the contrary, that Jesus was the Messiah, believers pored over the Jewish Scriptures searching for any prophecy regarding the Messiah and write the fulfillment of those prophecies back into the life of Jesus, changing details wherever instructed by the "Holy Spirit."

As for Jesus’ elevation to the status as God, the early Christian community believe that he was deified upon his resurrection as attested by Pre-literary Traditions (terse statements in tightly structured formats with parallel statements).

One such fragment appears in Paul:

Romans 1<A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Romans-1-3/">:3</A> Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh; <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Romans-1-4/">4</A> And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:

Paul was planning a mission to Spain and required the help of the Christian community in Rome. Here he is trying to show that he is of one spirit with them by appealing to an earlier statement of faith, using phrases not characteristic of Paul (‘seed of David,’ ‘spirit of holiness,’ and not reflective of his beliefs (Jesus becoming the son of God at Resurrection).

Two more appear in Acts:

Acts 2:36 Peter: Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made the same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.

Acts 13:33 Paul: God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second Psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.

Acts (written 80-85 AD) furthermore cannot be a record of the actual speeches, as Peter, an illiterate Aramaic- speaker, sounds just like Paul, an educated Greek-speaker.

For the evangelist Mark, Jesus was adopted by God at his baptism. Such adoption was common in the Roman world (cf, Octavian). As the community develops and the gospels are written, the divinization of Jesus is pushed further and further back: from the resurrection for the pre-literary tradition, to baptism for Mark, to his birth for Matthew and Luke, and finally to the moment of creation for John.

Jesus and James vs Paul and Augustine

What is Jesus’ teaching regarding salvation?

Jesus here gives a clear protocol for salvation; namely, to help those in need, even anonymously.

Matthew 25 - Parable of the Sheep and Goats

Mt 25:31 When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: 25:32 And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats: 25:33 And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. 25:34 Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: 25:35 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: 25:36 Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me. 25:37 Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?  25:38 When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?  25:39 Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?  25:40 And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me. 25:41 Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels: 25:42 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink: 25:43 I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not. 25:44 Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?  25:45 Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me. 25:46 And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.

According to Jesus’ explanation of salvation here, his crucifixion is not necessary; baptism of the saved person is not necessary; even recognition of Jesus’ identity is not necessary, much less faith or belief in any doctrine other than helping those in need.  On the other hand, turning away from those in need, which so-called Christians find easy today, is condemned in terms just as clear.

James the Just

Who leads the Jerusalem Church after Jesus’ sudden, violent  death? According to Acts, it is Peter, but Paul lists James prior to “Cephas” (Peter) and John as those considered "pillars" of the Jerusalem Church. Further, Eusebius records that Clement of Alexandria wrote that Peter, James, and John chose James, the brother of Jesus, as bishop of Jerusalem. As is made clear in his Epistle, James emphasizes Jesus’ doctrine of salvation by ‘works.’

from the Epistle of James

2<A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-14/">:14 What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-14/">he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-15/">15 If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-15/">food, 16 And one of you say unto them, Depart in</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-16/">peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-16/">them not those things which are needful to the body;</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-16/">what doth it profit? 17 Even so faith, if it hath not works,</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-17/">is dead, being alone. 18 Yea, a man may say, Thou hast</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-18/">faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-18/">works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works. 19</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-19/">Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well:</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-19/">the devils also believe, and tremble. 20 But wilt thou</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-20/">know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead? 21</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-21/">Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-21/">he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar? 22 Seest</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-22/">thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-22/">was faith made perfect? 23 And the scripture was</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-23/">fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it</A> <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-23/">was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was</A> called the Friend of God. <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-24/">24 Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-25/">25 Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers,</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-25/">and had sent them out another way? 26 For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without</A>   <A HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-26/">works is dead also.</A>

This epistle was specifically written to contradict Paul, who was then proselytizing salvation by faith alone. James and Paul also differed over whether to preach to Gentiles, widening the rift in the early church, as indicated in Galatians 2:9ff.

~~~~~~~

Paul of Tarsus

Paul of Tarsus, an apocalyptic Pharisee of the diaspora community in Asia Minor, initially feels that Christian claims that Jesus is the Messiah are absurd to the point of being blasphemous. He is very intelligent and well read in the Septuagint (the source of all his quotations of Scripture). He participates in the suppression of the Christians and may well have been present at the martyrdom of St. Stephen. On the road to Damascus he has a nervous breakdown, due probably to the echoes of Isaiah condemning oppression of the poor ringing in his ears, since early Christian communities were most likely comprised largely of the socio-politically disadvantaged.

His breakdown is likely also, considering his later hostility to the Jewish Law, a result of his view that Pharisaic obsession with minutiae of the Law of Moses is superfluous to the central Biblical message of the Two Great Commandments to love God and one’s neighbor. During his seizure he has a vision of the resurrected Jesus from whom he learns “his gospel.” He then fastidiously avoids going to see other Apostles for three years, during which time he formulates his message, the gist of which is as follows:
1. Jesus rose from the dead, hence he is blessed of God, not cursed as would be anyone “hanged upon a tree.”
2. Since he is blessed, his death must have been directed by God; it cannot have been a random event.
3. His death must be a sacrifice; but he is blameless, so it must be a sacrifice for others.
4. Others must therefore be guilty, but of what? Ah, the sin of Adam (original sin) must have universal effect.
5. How can we benefit from this sacrifice? Only by baptism, whereby we are cleansed of Adam’s sin and may receive God’s grace.
6. Is that enough? No, we must consciously accept and believe in Jesus’ sacrifice; otherwise we won’t be saved.
7. Isn’t it enough to help those in need, as Jesus taught in the Parable of the Sheep and Goats? No, if that were sufficient, then Jesus would not have been required to die on the cross.

This entire system of ideas was constructed to defend Paul’s cherished belief that Jesus’ crucifixion was necessary. All the rest of the elaborate tissue emerges from this one flawed tenet.

When Paul encounters resistance from Jews who do not share his deviant reading of Jewish Scripture, he reacts by taking his message to Gentiles. That he was a convincing speaker is undeniable. In certain cases, people (e.g., his jailer) seem to have been “converted” without having the slightest understanding of what he preached.

Indeed, Paul himself could not willfully contradict Jesus’ teaching because he simply did not know Jesus’ teaching. When he wrote his Epistles (~50CE) there were as yet no gospels and he avoided contact with the Apostles. What his writings reflect  about Jesus is limited to: the fact that Jesus was Jewish, was born of a woman, had a brother named James, taught his followers to pay their preachers and not to divorce, performed the Last Supper, and was crucified. He never quotes Jesus, even when discussing an issue about which Jesus spoke convincingly . He never says, “Jesus taught,” but always “I taught.” If we compare Jesus’ teachings to Paul’s, discrepancies are evident:

While both Jesus and Paul were apocalypticists who taught love of God and of neighbor, Jesus taught turning the other cheek, while Paul bitterly attacked his enemies; Jesus spurned Mammon, while Paul sought and cultivated the wealthy; Jesus felt disgust with the self-righteous, while Paul built a ‘righteous’ church bureaucracy; Jesus preached the imminence of the end, as did Paul at first, but when the end didn’t come, Paul adjusted his message; Jesus associated with sinners, while Paul associated with “believers”; Jesus taught salvation through good works, while Paul taught salvation through baptism and faith; Jesus lived as a Jew, while Paul rejected the Law and lived “as a Greek”; Jesus taught Jews to “follow the Law,” while Paul vehemently forbade Gentile converts to follow the Law.”

~~~~~~~

Suppression of the Jamesian Ebionites

So were there any believers in the early days who followed the teachings of Jesus and James? Yes, the Ebionites (“the poor”) follow James, are observant of the Jewish Law and rites, stress poverty and good works, and regard Jesus of Nazareth as “a prophet, the biological son of Mary and Joseph, who by virtue of his righteousness, was chosen by God to be a messianic prophet like Moses when he was anointed with the Holy Spirit at his baptism by John.”  They rejected Jesus’ pre-existence, divinity, virgin birth, atoning death, and physical resurrection. They use only the gospel of Matthew starting at chapter 3, revere James the brother of Jesus (James the Just), and reject Paul the Apostle as an apostate from the Law. They place a special value on voluntary poverty. ‘Ebionim’ is also among the terms used by the sect at Qumran (possibly Essenes) that sought to separate itself from the corruption of the Temple. The earliest reference to a group that might fit the description of the later Ebionites appears in Justin Martyr's Dialogue with Trypho (c. 140), while Irenaeus (c. 180) was probably the first to use the term "Ebionites" to describe the ‘heretical judaizing sect,’ which he regarded as stubbornly clinging to the Law. (This first mention does not mean that they emerged in 180CE, but only that they then became a problem for the proto-Orthodox.)

Heretic books burned by Papal decree

~~~~

After James’ death, a struggle ensues between the followers of James (‘faith without works is dead’) and those of Paul. The church in Jerusalem chooses Paul’s “gospel” and turns orthodox, likely because Paul’s version of salvation requires a devoted, sacramental, priestly, paternalistic hierarchy (a church), while Jesus’ and James’ version does not. Anyone who attacks the prerogatives of the Church by asserting the teachings of Jesus and James is branded a heretic, which brings us to the great contest between Pelagius and Augustine of Hippo.

Augustine of Hippo (354-430)

is best known for his ideas on the relationship between the will, grace, and predestination. Raised as a Christian by his mother, Monica, he reads Hortensius and becomes Manichaean. In 370 he begins a thirteen- year relationship with the mother (never named in his works) of his son, Adeodatus (born 372). In 383 he moves to Rome, is exposed to neo-Platonic idealism, and rejects Manichaeism. His mother joins him in Milan, forces him to send his child’s mother away, and arranges a marriage for him to a 10-year old Christian heiress. In 386 Augustine renounces his career and marriage, and is baptized by St. Ambrose. Augustine's core ideas even after his reconversion still reflect Manichaean concepts: Hell, Elect and Reprobates, hostility to the flesh and sexual activity, and dualistic theology. In 389, he writes Confessions, sells his patrimony, and gives the money to the poor. In 391 he is drafted as priest at Thagaste, near Carthage. In 410, Rome is sacked by Visigoths, and Christians are blamed for their unmanly, pacifist behavior, in answer to which he writes City of God.

<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Consecration_of_Saint_Augustine">Consecration of Saint Augustine</A>

The Pelagian Controversy:  Pelagius, a British monk, asserts that people are not born with a “sinful nature” and thus do not require the “cleansing” of infant baptism.  He claims that people can choose to live a good life or a bad life, and can thus choose salvation or damnation. He sees in Jesus not an atoning death “to wash away the sins of the world,” but merely a divine model of virtuous life. He considers death to be natural to all men (since baptism doesn’t confer immortality).

Like Pelagius, many early Church Fathers taught that humans have the power of free will and the choice over good and evil: Justin Martyr - "every created being is so constituted as to be capable of vice and virtue. For he can do nothing praiseworthy, if he had not the power of turning either way." Theophilus   - "If, on the other hand, he would turn to the things of death, disobeying God, he would himself be the cause of death to himself. For God made man free, and with power of himself." Irenaeus - "But man, being endowed with reason, and in this respect similar to God, having been made free in his will, and with power over himself, is himself his own cause that sometimes he becomes wheat, and sometimes chaff." Clement of Alexandria  - "We...have believed and are saved by voluntary choice." Before Pelagius, even Augustine suggested that the will is confronted by a rational choice between a life spent in the pursuit of what is temporal, changing, and perishable, and a life spent in the pursuit of what is eternal, immutable, and incapable of being lost [De Libero Arbitrio I.7]; and that God's grace is "a reward for human assent,” that will is independent to choose good or evil, and that salvation is thus in the hands of the believer. However, as Pelagianism spreads rapidly, especially around Carthage, Augustine changes his tune and reacts to this attack upon the sacraments by accusing Pelagius of heresy at the Council of Carthage in 418. Augustine’s logic is similar to Paul’s: if good deeds can save us, why did Jesus have to die on the cross? To defeat Pelagius and uphold the Sacramental Church, Augustine devises a system whereby salvation is gained only by “irresistible” divine will; namely, that people have no choice. Likewise, damnation is the result of divine grace withheld, in which case people again have no choice. “Grace irresistibly changes our will so that those chosen cannot reject it, and those from whom it is withheld cannot be saved.”  [De Gratia et Libero Arbitrio xx and xxi]. Augustine is even pushed by the absurdity of his position to argue that unbaptized babies, and by extension miscarried or aborted babies, burn in Hell for all eternity. Also, misreading Genesis, Augustine maintains that death is a consequence of original sin (yet it is curiously not remedied by baptism or Jesus’ crucifixion).

In order to maintain its monopoly on the machinery of salvation, the Church endorses Augustine.

The Gospel (not by Mark, but) according to Mark

The first Gospel is written - Jesus is portrayed as the misunderstood prophet (Adoptionism). In Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus the gospel actually ends at 16:8, as noted by Eusebius and Jerome, though Irenaeus (200 CE) cites verse 19, demonstrating that the early Church Fathers probably made the addition in order to harmonize Mark with the other gospels.

Mark 16:8 ‘And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any man; for they were afraid.’

0065 Sources of Gospel stories: The Gospels are written by those inspired by the Holy Spirit (i.e., IMAGINATION!). For example, when they read in Micah that the Messiah rose out of Egypt, of course the Spirit makes them think it must be Jesus who rose out of Egypt, so Matt 2:13 puts him in Egypt.

Often gospel stories mirror those of the pagan faiths around them. For example, the immaculate conception of Plato, whose mother Perictione was impregnated by Apollo, who declared to Ariston, to whom she was betrothed, the parentage of the child; the story of an evil serpent sent to ruin paradise was taught to the Jews by the Babylonians during the Captivity; also, the ideas of resurrection, the immortality of the soul, and dualism were taught not by Jews, but by Persians and incorporated into the Judaeo-Christian mythology during the Persian period of occupation.

Where is God? The First Jewish-Roman War - The Second Temple is destroyed

Judaism again loses its raison d’être. This is a huge shock to the fundamental system of Judaism.

0070 Diaspora is considered the ultimate punishment for people fallen away from God, but the Babylonian community is a success. With Hellenism, borders disappear, and Jews follow business opportunities, and actually convert some Gentiles. Because Babylon is outside the Hellenist world, its Jewish community keeps its exclusionist identity. Philo: ‘The diaspora is the realization of God’s promise to Abraham.’

0070 Rabbis: With the Temple gone - who’s in charge? Yohanan Ben Zakkai (30 BC-90 AD) - ‘When in doubt, plant a tree.’ Ritual is modified, as is use of the shofar, which thitherto could only be sounded in the Temple. The new rabbinical model is based not on birth, but vocation. Rabbis are mobile and establish local centers; the nature of ritual is changed from sacrifice to reading and prayer in synagogues. Then Rabban Gamaliel (Acts 5:34) establishes a bureaucracy, supports Rome, and is named patriarch. Prayer is introduced into the synagogues, especially the Amida Prayer, including a benediction against the minim (Christian heretics?). Unlike the time of the destruction of the First Temple, Jews are now more ready to expect the End - Where is God? Was God defeated? Is there a new covenant? People are ready for extreme means and ends.

0080 Gnosticism - Non-rabbinical Jewish sects and early Christian sects of Gnosticism develop, out of the remains of apocalyptic  expectations after the fall of Jerusalem (70 AD), which shatters the hopes of the coming of God's kingdom on earth and leads to a rejection of the world. Within early Christianity, the teachings of Paul and John may have been a starting point for Gnostic ideas, with a growing emphasis on the opposition between flesh and spirit, the value of charisma, and the disqualification of the Jewish law. Tertullian calls Paul "the apostle of the heretics," because Paul's writings were attractive to Gnostics, and interpreted in a Gnostic way, while Jewish Christians felt he strayed from the Jewish roots of Christianity. Paul wrote to the Corinthian church members as "having knowledge." Gnostic ideas find a Jewish variation in the mystical study of Kabbalah.

0080 The Gospel according to Matthew - Jesus as the Jewish Messiah
0085 The Gospel according to Luke and the Acts of the Apostles - Jesus as the Universal Savior
0090 The Gospel according to John - Jesus as The Word made Flesh

The Early Church Fathers

Writings of the Apostolic Fathers: First Clement (c. 120 CE)- The Church of Rome intrudes in Corinth; Ignatius' Letters (c. 120 CE) - seven letters regarding his going to Rome to be martyred; Letter(s) of Polycarp to the Philippians (c.125 CE) - against Docetists and Resurrection-deniers; Martyrdom of Polycarp (c. 155 CE) - "Away with the atheists!"

0115 Jewish Rebellion in Egypt and Cyrene, led by (king?) Lucas/Andreas

0130 Papias Bishop of Hieropolis. (c. 70-c. 155 CE) Christian apologists for early gospel dates rely on the slimmest of evidence, including a very late third-hand testimony of a late second-hand testimony that "Mark" had written a narrative, supposedly based on the experiences of Peter as related by the apostle himself. In the fourth century, Church historian Eusebius quotes Papias of Hierapolis as referring to the "presbyter John." Regarding the bishop of Hierapolis, the Catholic Encyclopedia says, "Of Papias's life nothing is known." According to Eusebius—in disagreement with Irenaeus, who suggests Papias had known the apostle John—Papias has no direct acquaintance with any of the apostles: …Papias himself in the preface to his Exposition of the Sayings of the Lord makes clear that he was never a hearer or eyewitness of the holy apostles, and tells us that he learnt the essentials of the faith from their former pupils. The assumption that the "presbyter John" with whom Papias apparently had a relationship is the apostle John is evidently incorrect. Many of Papias' remarks, according to Eusebius, involve miracles, such as the raising of the dead, which test one’s credulity. Papias is one of the only pieces of evidence Christian apologetics offers as to the dating of the gospels—yet, his testimony concerning these writings of Mark and Matthew is not only second-hand but also too late to possess any value as concerns the earliest of the gospels dates. Moreover, Papias speaks only about a narrative by Mark, which by no means conclusively refers to the canonical Mark as we have it. Nor is the Aramaic gospel of Matthew the same as the canonical Matthew.

0132-0135 Hadrian plans to rebuild Jerusalem as a Hellene city, Aelia Capitolina. Fears of pagan worship on Temple Mount (just as those that preceded the Machabean rebellion) occurring 70 years after the destruction of the Temple (just as the Temple was rebuilt in 516, 70 years after its destruction in 586) inspire Nasi (“king”) Simon Bar Kochba to rise as a military Messiah against the Evil Empire (Rome). A definitive defeat was required before Jews could resign themselves to a “Judaism of the possible.” He is, however, not supported by any rabbis except Akiva, and the revolt fails. Jews are now banned from Jerusalem, and Judea is renamed Syria-Palestina. The Messianic model becomes spiritual rather than military for Jews. The Babylonian rabbinic community takes precedence. What about Jews living outside the Holy Land? Philo of Alexandria is an example of successful adaptation.

~~~~~~~~

The Age of Heresy

0144 Marcionism - Marcion believes Jesus is the savior sent by God, and Paul is his chief apostle, but he rejects the Hebrew Bible and God of the Old Testament as a tyrant or demiurge. Marcionists believe that the God of the Old Testament is a separate and lower entity than the all-forgiving God of the New Testament. This belief is similar to Gnostic theology - both are dualistic, that is, they posit (Manichaean) opposing gods, forces, or principles: one higher, spiritual, and "good," and the other lower, material, and "evil." This dualism stands in contrast to other Christian and Jewish views that "evil" has no independent existence, being merely an absence of "good." Marcion’s canon consists of eleven books: an abridged Gospel of Luke and ten Pauline epistles. The premise of Marcionism is that many of the teachings of Jesus are incompatible with the actions of the Hebrew God.  He further regards the arguments of Paul regarding law and gospel, wrath and grace, works and faith, flesh and spirit, sin and righteousness, death and life, as the essence of religious truth.  Marcionites hold that the God of the Hebrew Bible (known to Gnostics as Yaltabaoth) is inconsistent, jealous, wrathful and genocidal, and that the material world he created is defective, a place of suffering; the God who made such a world is a bungling or malicious <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demiurge">demiurge.</A>  Marcionism shows the influence of <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic">Hellenistic</A>  philosophy on Christianity, by presenting a moral critique of the Old Testament from the standpoint of <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonism">Platonism.</A> According to Harnack, the sect may have led other Christians to introduce a formal statement of beliefs into their liturgy and to formulate a canon of authoritative <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_text">Scripture</A> of their own, thus <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_of_the_New_Testament_canon">eventually producing the current canon of the New Testament.</A>

0150 Justin Martyr (c. 150 CE) As proof of the existence of the gospels prior to the end of the second century, it is claimed that Church father Justin Martyr included 268 "quotations of the New Testament" in his First Apology  (cf. New Evidence that Demands a Verdict by Josh McDowell).

0180 Irenaeus (fl. 180 CE) "Father of the Catholic Canon." The four canonical gospels were not mentioned or named as such by anyone until the time of Church Father Irenaeus, Bishop of Lyons. In Against All Heresies (III, 11.8), Irenaeus is the first to name the canonical gospels and give reasons for their inclusion in the New Testament.

0180 Theophilus (Luke’s Theophilus?), Bishop of Antioch (Luke’s home town), is the first Church father clearly to discuss the canonical gospels.

0200 The Mishna, a rabbinical guidebook, is compiled by Nasi Judah the Patriarch; later, the Talmud (ancient rabbinic writings) is written: one in Babylon (more popular), and one in Jerusalem, as a commentary on the Mishna.

0200 Docetism (Marcionism) - Docetists maintain that Jesus’ human form is an illusion, as testified by the uncanonical Gospel of Peter. This system of beliefs is condemned by Polycarp and Serapion.

0220 Sabellianism - God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit are three different modes or aspects of one monadic God, as perceived by the believer, rather than three distinct persons within the Godhead - that there are no real or substantial differences between the three, such that there is no substantial identity for the Spirit or the Son. At the Arroyo Seco World Wide Camp Meeting, near Los Angeles, in 1913, <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadians">Canadian</A> evangelist <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.E._McAlister">R.E. McAlister</A> states at a baptismal service that the apostles baptized in the name of Jesus only and not in the triune Name of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (Sabellianism is not dead!).

The Real Story of Christmas

“Christmas” is a non-Biblical celebration, that is to say, it is mentioned nowhere in the Bible, was not practiced by the Early Church, and Church Father Origen (c. 184-c. 253 CE) declared it a pagan practice and its celebration a sin.

The date of Jesus’ birth is a matter of speculation, but the four Biblical hints do not favor December 25: first, the Star of Bethlehem, if a juncture of Venus and Jupiter, occurred on June 17, 2 BCE, while that of Jupiter and Saturn occurred in October 7 BCE; second, shepherds tend their flocks “in the field” (Luke 2:8 αγραυλουντες</span><span class="cls_003">)</span></div from May to October, not in December; third, Zacharias’ service as Priest (Luke 1:8-11, 23-24, 26-27)  indicates the birth of John the Baptist in March, and that of Jesus six months later; finally, censuses were forbidden in December, as that was a difficult travel month (Ezra 10:9-13). October might fit, but not December.

On the other hand, the Saturnalia, in honor of a Roman agricultural deity, with drunken reveling, gift-giving, and the reversal of roles between slaves and masters, was celebrated each year until around December 23. Also, in 274 CE, Roman Emperor Aurelian declared December 25 to be a festival in honor of “the birth of Sol Invictus,” (winter solstice as the birth of the sun) a Mithraic sun-god cult characterized by handshakes and ritual meals before altars in underground temples.

In 313 CE, in an effort to unite his dissolving Empire, Emperor Constantine issued the Edict of Milan, declaring religious tolerance for Christianity, and later presided over the Council of Nicaea in 325 CE. As masses of Romans now converted to Christianity, they refused to give up their celebratory feasts at the Solstice. A moral debate raged among the clergy, some of whom felt that fallen humankind needed a season of abandonment and excess (from which they could be gradually weaned), as long as it was carried on under the umbrella of Christian supervision, while others argued that all vestiges of paganism must be expunged. The Church compromised by recognizing December 25 as the nativity not of the Sun-god, but of the Son of God. In 742 CE, though, St. Boniface complained to Pope Zacharias that the Franks and Germans, whom he was trying to convince to give up their pagan carnivals, had witnessed such celebrations in the shadow of St. Peter’s itself!

Over subsequent centuries, Christmas absorbed further pagan symbols from Germans (Yule logs), Scandinavians (decorated evergreen trees) and Druids (mistletoe). Reformation Protestants tried reforming Christmas but had little impact. In 1659 English Puritans outlawed Christmas as unchristian, but it proved so popular that it was “restored” in 1681.

More Heresies!

0276 Manichaeism - Manichaeism teaches an elaborate <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dualistic_cosmology">dualistic cosmology</A> describing the <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_between_good_and_evil">struggle</A>  between a <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodness_and_value_theory">good,</A> spiritual world of light; and an <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil">evil,</A> material world of darkness. Through an ongoing process that takes place in human history, light is gradually removed from the world of matter and returned to the world of light, whence it came. Its beliefs are rooted in Zoroastrian dualism preserved in <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnostic">gnostic</A> religious movements. Manichaeism spreads with extraordinary speed both east and west. It reaches Rome through the apostle Psattiq by 280 CE, via <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt">Egypt,</A> where it flourishes in the <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fayum">Fayum</A> area c. 290.

This results in martyrdom for many in Egypt and North Africa. In 354, <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilary_of_Poitiers">Hilary of Poitiers</A> writes that the Manichaean faith is a significant force in southern Gaul. In 381, Christians request that <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodosius_I">Theodosius I</A> strip Manichaeans of their civil rights. He issues a decree of death for Manichaean monks in 382.

0300 Arianism - “Jesus was begotten by and is subordinate to the Father,” a belief held today by Jehovah’s Witnesses.

0325 The First Council of Nicaea is summoned to resolve a disagreements arising from within the  <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Alexandria">Church of Alexandria</A> over Arianism:  whether the Son was 'begotten' by the Father from his own being, and therefore had no beginning, or else was created out of nothing, and therefore had a beginning. This hyper-intellectualization of Christianity allows total control over the message, and of course the loser of the debate, Arius, is banished.

0350 Donatism - Elements of the Church attack apostate clergy who had collaborated with the Roman persecutors as unworthy to administer sacraments. <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo">Augustine of Hippo</A> campaigns against Donatism as bishop, and through his efforts, orthodoxy gains the upper hand. According to Augustine, sacramental validity is a property of the priesthood independent of the individual character of the priest. Influenced by the <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Testament">Old Testament,</A> he believes in discipline as a means of education. In his letter to Vincentius, Augustine uses the <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament">New Testament Parable of the Great Banquet</A> to justify using force against the Donatists: "You are of the opinion that no one should be compelled to follow righteousness; and yet you read that the householder said to his servants, 'Whomsoever ye shall find, compel them to come in.'" The Church thereafter conveniently uses Augustine's texts to justify the use of force in the <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_pagans_in_the_late_Roman_Empire">persecution of pagan religions,</A> of heretics by the <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquisition">Inquisition,</A> and of Native American  <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_American_religion">religions.</A>

The early reformers <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wycliffe">John Wycliffe</A> (d. 1384), who teaches that the moral corruption of priests invalidates their offices and sacraments, and <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Hus">Jan Hus</A> (d. 1415), who argues that a prelate's moral character determines his ecclesiastical authority, are accused of Donatism and condemned as <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heresy">heret</A>ics at the <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Constance">Council of Constance</A> (1414-8).

0367 Athenasius, bishop of Alexandria, determines the canonical Scriptures of New Testament; the Gnostic Nag Hamadi text of the Gospel of Thomas is hidden by Gnostics shortly thereafter.

0381 Monophysitism maintains that after the union of the divine and the human in the person of <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Christ">Jesus</A> <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Christ">Christ,</A> he had only a single "nature" which was divine. Monophysitism is contrasted to <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyophysitism">duophysitism,</A>  which maintains that Christ maintained two natures, one divine and one human after incarnation.

Monophysitism is born in the theological <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_of_Alexandria">"School</A>   <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_of_Alexandria">of Alexandria,</A>" which begins its Christological analysis with the (divine) eternal Son or Word of God and seeks to explain how this eternal Word became incarnate as a man — in contrast to the <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_of_Antioch">"School of Antioch</A>" (birthplace of  <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestorianism">Nestorianism,</A> the antithesis of Monophysitism), which instead begins with the (human) Jesus of the Gospels and seeks to explain how this man became united with the eternal Word in the Incarnation. Accepted by the Sees of Rome, Constantinople, and Antioch, the Chalcedonian settlement (451CE) encounters strong resistance in Alexandria (and in Egypt generally), leading ultimately to the schism between the Oriental Orthodox churches (which reject Chalcedon) on the one hand, and the so-called <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalcedonian">Chalcedonian</A>  churches on the other. There are two major doctrines that can indisputably be called "monophysite":

St. Dioscorus (left), Pope of Alexandria

(1) <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollinarianism">Apollinarianism</A> holds that Christ had a human body and human "living principle," but that the <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logos_(Christianity)">Divine Logos</A> took the place of the <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nous">nous</A> (mind). Apollinarianism is condemned as a heresy at the First Ecumenical Council of Constantinople in 381. (2) <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutychianism">Eutychianism</A> holds that the human and divine natures of Christ were fused into one new single nature: His human nature was "dissolved like a drop of honey in the sea." Eutychianism is condemned at the Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon in 451, and again at the non-chalcedonian Third Council of Ephesus in 475.

0420 Nestorianism - <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyophysite">dyophysitism: "Jesus</A> Christ, who is not identical with the Son but personally united with the Son, who lives in him, is one <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypostasis_(philosophy_and_religion)">hypostasis</A> and one nature: human."

Into the Middle Ages

0754 The Donation of Constantine - In 751 Aistulf, king of the Lombards (a Scandinavian horde), conquers what remains of the Byzantine Empire in northern Italy and demands the submission of Pope Stephen II in Rome. In France, Pepin the Short, Mayor of the Palace of Neustria and Austrasia and a Roman Catholic, deposes the last Merovingian king and claims the throne as King of the Franks, yet lacks consensus for his rule. Stephen is in desperate need of an ally against the Lombards and so approaches Pepin with the promise of monarchical legitimacy in return for his support. The Donation of Constantine, by which the Emperor Constantine in 315 (or 317) gave to Pope Sylvester I the right to temporal rule over Western Europe, is likely forged for the occasion. Stephen, by the authority vested in the Donation, anoints Pepin King of the Franks in a ceremony recalled in French coronation rites down to 1792. Pepin returns the favor by granting Stephen the Lombard territories he takes in northern and central Italy (the Rome-Ravenna Corridor that becomes the Papal States). In 778, Pope Hadrian refers to the Donation in requesting further land-grants from Charlemagne. The forgery is exposed by Latinist scholar Lorenzo Valla in 1440, though doubts as to its authenticity had been voiced by Emperor Otto III as early as 1001.

Where’s Waldo?

1173 Waldensians - Wealthy merchant <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Waldo">Peter Waldo</A> gives away his property and preaches <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostolic_poverty">apostolic</A>   <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostolic_poverty">poverty</A> as the way to <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfection">perfection.</A> He teaches that: temporal offices and dignities are not meant for preachers of the Gospel; that saints’ relics are simply rotten bones which belonged to one knew not whom; that to go on pilgrimage serves no end, save to empty one's purse; that meat might be eaten any day; that holy water is no more efficacious than rain water; and that prayer in a barn is just as effectual as that offered in a church.

Waldensians are accused of having scoffed at the doctrine of <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transubstantiation">transubstantiation,</A> and of having spoken blasphemously of the Catholic Church as the <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whore_of_Babylon">harlot of the Apocalypse.</A> They reject what they perceive as the idolatry of the Catholic Church and consider the Pope the Antichrist of Rome. They believe in such issues as the universal priesthood, preaching the gospel in the vulgar tongue, and taking up voluntary poverty. The Catholic Church views the Waldensians as heretical, and in 1184 at the <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synod_of_Verona">Synod</A>   <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synod_of_Verona">of Verona,</A> under the auspices of <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Lucius_III">Pope Lucius III,</A> they are excommunicated. Pope Innocent III goes even further during the <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Lateran_Council">Fourth Lateran Council</A> in 1215, officially denouncing the Waldensians as  <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heresy">heretics.</A> In 1211 more than 80 Waldensians are burned as heretics at <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strasbourg">Strasbourg,</A> launching several centuries of <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Inquisition">persecution</A> that nearly destroy the movement. The group is nearly annihilated in the seventeenth century and is confronted with organized and generalized discrimination in the centuries that followed.

St Augustine taught that error has no rights. He cited biblical texts to justify the use of compulsion, notably Luke 14:16-23. Had not Christ himself blinded St Paul in order to make him see the true light? According to Augustine, coercion using “great violence” was justified. He made a distinction between unbelievers, who persecuted because of cruelty, and Christians, who persecuted because of love. A war to preserve or restore the unity of the Church was a just war, a bellum Deo auctore, a war waged by God himself.

Inquisitions

are institutions of the Catholic Church established to combat heresy, started in 1184 in France to root out Cathars and Waldensians in Southern France. In the papal bull Ad Extirpanda of 1252, Pope Innocent IV explicitly authorizes the use of torture to elicit confessions from suspected heretics. Inquisitions were largely abolished after the Napoleonic Wars in Europe, but the office still exists in the Catholic Church, though now called the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith. Most sentences seem to have consisted of penances like wearing a cross sewn on one's clothes, going on pilgrimage, etc., though unrepentant heresy was often punished by burning at the stake.

Spanish Inquisition

Inquisitions occur in all lands and colonies where the Catholic Church has authority (except England and Castille), of which the most notorious is the Spanish Inquisition. The Iberian Peninsula in 1492 consists of territories recently reconquered from the Muslims and still retains strong Muslim and Jewish influence.  Muslims and Jews are given the choice of leaving, converting, or dying. Many stay and convert, though the Christian authorities doubt that all these conversos will suddenly become and remain orthodox Roman Catholics. So this Inquisition has a special socio-political basis as well as fundamental religious motives. The last execution of the Spanish Inquisition occurs in 1826 when Cayetano Ripoll is garroted for teaching Deism.

Roman Inquisition

After the Protestant Reformation explodes onto the scene, Catholic authorities become suspicious of the vary Renaissance humanism that they earlier encouraged. In 1542 Pope Paul III establishes the Roman Inquisition to examine and proscribe errors and false doctrines. The most famous case it tries is that of Galileo Galilei in 1633, for claiming that the sun is the center of the solar system. Galileo is found “vehemently suspect of heresy,” is threatened with torture if he does not recant his teachings; he recants, and is kept under house arrest until his death in 1642

Witches

The medieval church initially condemns belief in witches as a pagan superstition, but folk beliefs refuse to die. Local folk practice often mix chants, incantations, and prayers to the saints to ward off storms, protect cattle, or ensure a good harvest. Bonfires on Midsummer's Eve are intended to deflect natural catastrophes or the influence of fairies, ghosts, and witches. The punishment for evil witchcraft is death, but there are few prosecutions because of the Law of Talion, which stipulates that if the accused witch is not found guilty, the accuser will pay the penalty of death. The difficulty of proving witchcraft is sufficient to discourage frivolous accusations. In the 1230’s, however, Inquisitors, who accuse on behalf of the Church rather than an individual and are thus free of the restrictions of the Law of Talion, link heresy to magic. Before 1252, there is only about one prosecution per year. Then Inquisitors, authorized by Pope Innocent IV, begin to use torture to interrogate heretic magicians. When a suspected witch is reported to the Inquisitors, the individual is interrogated. If no confession is forthcoming, torture is employed, and the accused starts to confess to almost anything, and to accuse other “members” of their “sabbat” (coven).

From 1375 -1435 there is a marked increase in prosecutions, and treatises on witchcraft begin to appear, possibly in answer to the upheavals of the era - the Black Death (1347), the Hundred Years' War (1337-1453), the Little Ice Age (~1500-1700), and the Protestant Reformation (1517) - and these folk superstitions percolate up into Church leadership. Still, as late as 1484, local German church officials are reluctant to participate in the Inquisition, and one even expels Dominican priest Heinrich Kramer from his diocese in Innsbruck for making false accusations. In his influential book Malleus Maleficarum, published in 1487,Kramer expresses his beliefs that witchcraft is responsible for bad weather and that women are inherently susceptible to Satanic seduction because of their raging libido.

1500-1700 is the Golden Age for witch trials. By 1500 the concept of witches is well defined and widely accepted, being written about by recognized intellectual authorities of the age (including English king James I). Any misfortune which occurs, such a barn burning down, or the death of a child, or childlessness itself, can be ascribed to dark magic, and anyone who has a grudge against the victim of the misfortune is under suspicion. As always, the most vulnerable are most suspect, and the most vulnerable tend to be older women dependent upon the charity of others, most likely because of the death of a husband. If one spurns the advances of a beggar and returns home to find ones barn burnt down, the connection is clear. The fact that many of these women are emotionally fragile and sometimes confess merely for the attention only reinforces the community’s fears. Women are considered to be intellectually and morally inferior, and on that account bitter. Witches are also associated with a hunger for the flesh of infants, having animal familiars who aid in their fiendish plans, a special mark of their bodies that signifies their pact with Satan, and membership in a “synagogue” or “sabbat” of witches who participate in sexual orgies with demonic spirits.

The last witch executed in Europe is Anna Goeldin, decapitated on 13 June 1782 in Zurich after she confesses, under torture, to a pact with Satan. Her execution is described in the press as judicial murder.

1431 Joan of Arc, born a peasant at Domremy in northeast France, is considered a heroine of France for her role during the Hundred Years’ War. Joan claims to have received visions of the Archangel Michael, Saint Margaret, and Saint Catherine of Alexandria instructing her to recover France from English domination. The unanointed King Charles VII reluctantly sends Joan to the Siege of Orleans as part of a relief army. She gains prominence when the siege is lifted only nine days later. Several additional swift victories lead to Charles VII's consecration at Rheims. This paves the way for the final French victory.

On 23 May 1430, she is captured Burgundians. She is sold to the English after Charles VII refuses to ransom her, put on trial by the Inquisitor of North France Jean Lemaitre for witchcraft because she wore male clothing, and burnt at the stake at about nineteen years of age.

Her attribution of Divine Guidance annoys Church leaders, but she is finally canonized in 1920, though as late as 1902, Papal Consistors cite her capture as proof that her claims that she was sent by God are false, and refuse to place her in the Calendar of Saints.

Martin Luther

1517 Luther publishes his 95 Theses - and formulates a creed whereby humans are considered to be deeply corrupt, powerless to save themselves, and justified only through god's grace. The individual relates directly to god (without the intercession of a Church); that church is a place for sermons, not sacraments; and that only the Bible has authority (not the writings of Church Fathers). Protestant reformers Martin Luther and John Calvin agree with the post-Pelagian Augustine that Original Sin completely destroys liberty <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_depravity">(total depravity</A>), thereby presuming a lack of free will.

Luther was, unfortunately, also a vicious anti-Semite. In On the Jews and their Lies he asks:

"What shall we Christians do with this rejected and condemned people, the Jews":

"First, to set fire to their synagogues or schools … so that God might see that we are Christians …
Second, I advise that their houses also be razed.
Third, I advise that all their prayer books and Talmudic writings …be taken from them.
Fourth, I advise that their rabbis be forbidden to teach henceforth on pain of loss of life and limb …
Fifth, I advise that safe-conduct on the highways be abolished completely for the Jews…
Sixth, I advise that … all cash and treasure of silver and gold be taken from them …
Seventh, I recommend putting a flail, an ax, a hoe, a spade, a distaff, or a spindle into the hands of young, strong Jews and Jewesses and letting them earn their bread in the sweat of their brow … But if we are afraid that they might harm us, … then let us eject them forever from the country …"

A little further on, he writes "we are at fault in not slaying them."

As a result of Luther’s influence, his Prince, John Frederick I, Elector of Saxony, in 1543 revoked concessions granted to his Jewish community; John of Brandenburg-Küstrin repealed the safe conduct of Jews in his territories; Luther's followers sacked the synagogue of Berlin in 1572 and in the following years the Jews were driven out of Brandenburg and several other German Lutheran states.

Shortly after the Kristallnacht, Martin Sasse, Bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Thuringia, published a compendium of Luther’s writings; Sasse: "On November 10, 1938, on Luther's birthday, the synagogues are burning in Germany."

The city of Nuremberg presented a first edition of On the Jews and their Lies to Julius Streicher, editor of the Nazi newspaper Der Stürmer, on his birthday in 1937. It was publicly exhibited in a glass case at the Nuremberg rallies. On December 17, 1941, seven Lutheran regional church confederations issued a statement agreeing with the policy of forcing Jews to wear the yellow badge, "since after his bitter experience Luther had strongly suggested preventive measures against the Jews and their expulsion from German territory."

1545 Council of Trent

The Catholic Church responds to the Protestant surge in Northern Europe with reform and religious wars. Jesuits open universities teaching Scholasticism infused with Renaissance humanism.

1630 Herbert of Cherbury contrasts revealed/positive religion to natural religion. Natural religion is universal, rational, and compatible with nature. Organized religion is by its nature corrupt.

1640~ Descartes asserts "natural reason," as the highest intellectual authority: ”cogito ergo sum.”

1666 Philipp Spener - The Pietists argue for spiritual and moral regeneration to overcome the sterility and abstractness of the Enlightenment, and maintain that god can be experienced directly. They criticize Kant as too universal, and lacking a personal experience of god. They seek a religion of the heart - ‘How do I know I'm saved?” “Accept Jesus as your personal savior.” The Great Awakening has arrived.

Caravaggio - The Pietist Schoolman

1687 Newton proves much previous Aristotelian ‘science’ wrong, thereby diminishing the role of God in the universe; the scientific revolution has begun.

Skepticism

1690 Locke - The first fruits of the Enlightenment: universal human reason, freedom from religious authority, superstition, even religion itself. Locke proposes a "reasonable" christianity, a "natural religion" based in reason, though accepting intuitive, self-evident principles.

1739 Hume is an Empiricist (knowledge is founded on sense perception), and a critic of religion, who questions whether one’s senses can confirm natural religion. He shows the limits of knowledge: argument from design is faulty because its cause (God) is not proportional to the observed effect (the world). Religion has its origin in human psychology, especially in fear and desire for power.

1767 Voltaire proposes Deism (belief in a non-interventionist supreme being), and gives a scathing critique of traditional Christianity. Opponents claim that without God, morality would collapse.

1770 Diderot, an atheist materialist: ‘Religious explanations cannot be rationally defended.’

1774 Unitarianism is a movement named for its belief that the God is one person, as opposed to a Trinity. Unitarians believe that Jesus was inspired in his moral teachings, and he is a savior, but he was not himself a god. Unitarianism also rejects the doctrines of original sin, predestination, Biblical inerrancy, and punishment in an eternal hell.

1774 Romanticism: In reaction to the implications of the Enlightenment, Romantics emphasize one’s spontaneous, emotional, creative side; the artistic-contemplative connection to nature; a mystical union with the divine that produces works of art beyond the reach of reason.

1780 Thomas Jefferson considers the teachings of Jesus as having "the most sublime and benevolent code of morals which has ever been offered to man," yet he holds that the pure teachings of Jesus appear to have been appropriated by some of Jesus' early followers, resulting in a Bible that contains both "diamonds" of wisdom and the "dung" of ancient political agenda. Jefferson used certain passages of the New Testament to compose <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Bible">The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth</A> (the "Jefferson Bible"), which stressed his moral message without any <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle">miracles</A> or reference to his divinity.

1781 Kant generates his "critical philosophy" - knowledge is based on the mind's active organization of sense experience. We canno experience the thing in itself, cannot know god, and so we must postulate god. All knowledge originates in sense experience organized by innate ideas - we can deduce a rational faith through regulative ideas (god, world, self) which bring unity at the highest level to experience. To act morally is to ignore all other incentives (emotion, self-interest) and to bind oneself to a universal moral law in the form of the categorical imperative - the principle of an act may be universalized. To act morally is to act autonomously, but our desire for happiness works subconsciously as we are seduced by "radical evil," which always subverts our moral action, so virtue and happiness don't coincide; hence we must postulate god and immortality, so that we have an infinite amount of time to progress toward virtue. Without these postulates, we would despair. Happiness and virtue will ultimately converge, but believers need a church to support and encourage them.

1807 Hegel

“History is the process whereby the Absolute Spirit empties itself into creation, and humans evolve from self-consciousness to god-consciousness.” He feels Kant is unable to reconcile the subjective and objective and Romantic emphasis on feeling and emotion. Kant is static, yet reality evolves. His inability to know the "thing in itself" is a mere stage in the growth of consciousness. Hegel is an idealist (reality consists of ideas), so while Kant's idealism is subjective, Hegel’s is absolute - we can know through our rational faculties. Spirit begins as undifferentiated, then successively differentiates until through dialectic achieving the reconciliation of Spirit. Religion is a social phenomenon to show people who they are; Protestantism makes priests of all believers, so that the divine is found not in church but in the state, and religion is eventually superseded by philosophy.

1810 Schleiermacher - Piety gives us experience of reality and our absolute dependence on god. Religion is a separate irreducible sphere of life; it is the sense and taste for the infinite, feeling part of the universe, in which we lose our sense of oneness and become one with the universe.

1835 David Strauss’ book The Life of Jesus posits that in Scripture people wrote a mythical rather historical text - true as myth, not as history. The gospels are true, even if they didn’t happen; they are parables meant to communicate a religious truth, just as Parson Weems invented the story of George Washington and the cherry tree.

1840 Emerson stresses defying convention and looking within for the unique insight (the Quaker Inner Light) granted to each individual, that no one else can find for one. "As men's prayers are a disease of the will, so are their creeds a disease of the intellect" (Self-Reliance, 1841).

~~~~~~~~

Kierkegaard

1841 Ludwig Feuerbach: “Religion prevents one from grappling with the reality of life.” God is a creation of the human imagination; we attribute to God crucial aspects of our own humanity, alienating ourselves from our true essence, masking and exacerbating fundamental forces of alienation and suffering; we must overcome belief in God and recover our own essence. Reality is ultimately material; Hegel's highest realities (self-consciousness, reason, and spirit) are aspects of humanity alienated by religion. We must renounce a god that requires exclusive faith commitments that separate us from other human beings, to come to a sense of ourselves again.

1843 Kierkegaard:  Abraham's killing of Isaac is a teleological suspension of the ethical by the spiritual, like that of Iphigenia, a murder of innocence for the greater good. His Night of Infinite Resignation stresses giving up this world in favor of the next (pandering to the hope of immortality). He posits faith by virtue of the Absurd - a leap of faith, but not blind faith - a human heart risking all, without justification, trusting in God's love. He attacks modern efforts to make Christianity reasonable; faith is only realized in passionate commitment. Faith is the struggle of a lifetime, an encounter with the creative source of life. Abraham's sacrifice of Isaac is murder, an act of faith, an act of infinite resignation, which views things of this world as unimportant compared with things eternal. Abraham has faith through the Absurd idea that he will get Isaac back. Kierkegaard's paradox: God's is transcendent; faith itself is a gift from god, that reason cannot grasp, so reason resents it, and because of sin cannot accept it.

An encounter with Jesus the teacher grants us the condition of acceptance and salvation. Religious truth comes to us from outside; salvation is not available except through Jesus. As sinners, we don't want to see it; our reason is offended, but God is absolutely different, while reason wants to domesticate God. Reason must recognize and accept its limits and surrender to the paradox. [Yet faith is likewise bound up with pride, and refuses to recognize a law outside itself - reason. Also, as long as we’re surrendering to paradoxes, how do we know which one? Doesn’t Islam or any cult leader make exactly the same claim that since reason can't arrive at their predetermined conclusion, we must abandon reason and “take the leap of faith and trust that God will catch you”? Of course, our “God-given” reason recoils at anything so monstrous as murdering one’s own child.]

1844 The YMCA is founded in London to put Christian principles into practice by developing a healthy "body, mind, and spirit."

~~~~~~~~

John Henry Newman and Marx

1845 John Henry Newman defends the authority of the church. One can know God only through self- denial and obedience, to which the Church is an indispensable guide. World history is moved by divine activity in a continuing revelation. Catholics must trust that the church is infallible.

1847 Horace Bushnell: Doctrines of sin and salvation cannot be dismissed; one must read the bible as inspiration and a poetic form of life, as different branches pointing at the same truth; doctrines evolve.

1848 Marx Religion is a false consciousness by which people delude themselves to cope with oppression; it is a psychological and social, rather than divine, phenomenon. Feuerbach's reversal of Hegel is an important step, but Feuerbach is mistaken in his view that the power of thought can change human life; Marx has an entirely materialistic interpretation: human emancipation will occur when we overcome the split between citizenship and civil society. The Communist Manifesto is issued in 1848, as anti- monarchical revolutions rock Europe, proclaiming the need for a proletarian revolution from below. The movement of history is not a matter of thought, but of human productive activity. Philosophers interpret the world; the point is to change it. Feuerbach thought of religion as a form of illness, splitting us in two; for Marx, religion is only a symptom - the sickness is inequality and oppression; religion is a palliative, the opium of the people, to make us forget how miserable we are, a false consciousness shaped by forces that it hides from itself. We must look below the surface to social material biological dynamics.

1852 Ritschl is a spokesman for liberal Protestants and modernist Catholics: there is no conflict between modernism and religion; doctrines are mere poetic expressions of religious experience. Ritschl, a Kantian considers Jesus the embodiment of ethical calling; divine grace is a spiritual freedom that makes moral action possible in the context of Christian tradition. Jesus’ ethical work justifies the Christian community. Salvation can come only through Jesus; Protestantism is the consummation of God's plan.

1865 The Salvation Army is founded to bring salvation to the poor, destitute, and hungry by meeting both their "physical and spiritual needs,” running charity shops, and operating shelters for the homeless.

1869 Modern “Christianity”: In order to appeal to a broader spectrum, and especially vibrant masculinity, religions compromise core values - "turning the other cheek" is replaced by a muscular embrace of military expansionism; serving the poor is replaced by "Acres of Diamonds."

1869 Ultramontanists - Catholic Anti-modernists give greater authority to the Pope. In 1854 Pius IX declares the teaching of the Immaculate Conception without consulting bishops; in 1864 he publishes The Syllabus of Errors condemning secularization and political liberalism; in 1869 the First Vatican Council declares him infallible based on Mt 16:18. In 1870, in answer to threats from secularization, Aquinas is declared to be the foundation of dogma.

1870 Bruno Bauer: Jews will be emancipated only when religion is abolished; the state offers us freedom in the abstract: Paul says there are neither slave nor free, neither male nor female, yet he supported slavery and subordination of women; the state makes us equal as citizens, yet allows deep inequalities; consciousness mystifies and ritualizes the social origins of alienation and domination.

~~~~~~~~

Liberal Protestant and Nietzsche

1875 Liberal Protestants - roots in Unitarian revolt against orthodox Calvinism - come into mainstream of US Protestantism; adapt religious ideas to modern culture (reconcile Christianity w/science); reject biblical literalism; stress ethical teachings of the Bible; ally w/“social gospel;” and urban revivalists; optimistic trust in community, focus on salvation and personal growth; accept evolution through “natural selection,” rejecting the “dogma of special creations.”

1879 Christian Scientists are founded by Mary Baker Eddy for those who believe faith can heal any illness.

1882 Nietzsche “God is dead!” True World theologies are debunked. True World theology (the idea that paradise exists, but not here) is of three types: Temporal (this world is the only reality, but is being guided and will be transformed in the future, yielding philosophies of history, like that of Marx), Monistic (individuals are identical to the universe, as in the Upanishads and transcendentalism and Zen), and Eternal (beside this earthly reality is a parallel Christian/Muslim/Buddhist heaven/hell).

For those who have cast off these psychological crutches, life is suddenly unhinged and seems meaningless. Mere material prosperity cannot solve the dilemma of meaning in life. People need the True World theories to protect them from the harsh realities of this world. Without them they sink into nihilism. According to Nietzsche, the conclusion that life is meaningless is mistaken: nihilism must be transcended. There are two types of nihilists: Passive Nihilists, for whom the rejection of the myth of an afterlife shatters their sense of order in the universe. Disoriented and searching for some meaning beyond narrow self-interest, they are often sucked into mass political movements. Active Nihilists, however, having realized the death of God, search within themselves for their unique meaning to life (their Will to Power); they “become who they are,” embrace adversity, and say “Yes!” to life.

The first step is to overcome the fear of non-conformity (like Emerson’s dictum, “Society punishes non-conformity.”) and laziness. A person requires an organizing idea. The specifics are not important, but one must look within to find one’s passion, one’s unique goal, one’s Will to Power. Adversity, far from being a cause for despair, is the very stuff of growth and life. Lasting happiness arises not through material wealth, or through following a religious phantasm, but only through struggle to achieve one’s self-appointed goal.

1883 Wellhausen develops the documentary hypothesis, a historical-critical method whereby the Bible is shown to be a text written and often edited by humans at various times.

1900 20th century New Atheists criticize the violence, irrationality, and intolerance of religion.

1902 Capitalist Christianity: "Coal mining is a business, not a religious, sentimental, or academic proposition. The rights and interests of the laboring man will be protected and cared for not by the labor agitators, but by the Christian men, to whom God in His infinite wisdom has given control of the property interests of the country." George F. Baer, President Philadelphia and Redding Coal and Iron Co.

Fundamentalism - Knees jerk, heads find the sand

1859 Darwin's Origin of the Species claims the world is far older than the Bible allows, and rejects history guided by God; natural selection contradicts the Bible claim that God created each species.

1874 What is Darwinism Charles Hodge attacks evolution as atheistic; he and others form the core of Princeton Theology, a fundamentalist doctrine;

1910-1915 AC Dixon The Fundamentals expresses opposition to modernism and higher criticism (the documentary hypothesis), and tries to make biblical theology an empiricist philosophy.

In Fundamentalism, three streams converge: those of Evangelicalism (Great Awakening), Dispensationalism (apocalypticism), and Princeton Theology (Biblical inerrancy), to assert five fundamental beliefs:
1) inerrancy of the Bible,
2) the <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_literalism">literal nature of the biblical accounts,</A> especially regarding Christ's miracles and the <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis_creation_narrative">Creation account in Genesis,</A>
3) the virgin birth of Christ,
4) the bodily resurrection and physical return of Christ, and
5) the <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitutionary_atonement">substitutionary atonement</A> of Christ on the cross.

In socio-political terms, fundamentalism reflects dismay over: the loss of the old religion-based Anglo- Saxon order; the movement from an agrarian to an urban society; immigration by non-white, non- Protestants; higher criticism poking holes in the Bible; the collapse of western values during World War I; the rise of unions; the rise of women; the rise of minorities; and the spread of secondary schools exposing children to secular ideas and religious doubt.

1915 Anger and dismay at modernism is channeled into the reborn political wing of the Fundamentalist movement, the Ku Klux Klan.

1916 Karl Barth’s Epistle to the Romans: The brutality of World War I causes a loss of confidence in modernism, and emphasizes God's transcendence. Barth agrees with Feuerbach that religion is ‘people talking about people.’ Barth prefers revelation - confession, acknowledgement of god's saving message. Much influenced by K, Barth asserts that God cannot be known, that religion is ultimately disbelief, that religion never gets beyond man to God, that religion is justification of ourselves, that theology is anthropology, that one should be suspicious of religion, that we should allow God to reach us through revelation, taken on faith. But trying to defend this confession is to acknowledge that humans can judge and explain God (uh-oh); one must read the Bible as the witness of God's revelation. On the left, he rejects Schleiermacher’s transcendence; and on the right, he rejects biblical inerrancy and total depravity. The bases of faith, however, he considers a priori.

1919 Prohibition passes, a predominantly Fundamentalist cause.

~~~~~~~~

What it’s all about?

1920 Freud: Religion is an illusion that helps us repress fundamental conflicts at the heart of our psychic life, the expression of our repressed desires in coded ways, originating in an Oedipal complex, with simultaneous love and hate for the Father. God is a form of wish fulfillment, a Father to whom we can express our love and who will forgive us for our hate; that is, our sin. Religion is a false consciousness hiding conflict between amoral pleasure and reality; it is a negotiation between the id and ego; it is a mass neurosis. Consciousness is shaped by repression of desire; civilization is built on coercion and renunciation. Religion is an effect of repression and the inability of humans to confront unavoidable psychic conflict.

1923 The New Geology by Fundamentalist George McCready Price: the creation of the Earth occurred on a Tuesday in 4004 BCE.

1925 The Butler Act bans teaching evolution; hence the Scopes Trial, during which William Jennings Bryan attacks the “oligarchy of scientists.” Bryan is humiliated on the stand and dies a week later.

1920’s School textbook publishers self-censor controversial science to suit Fundamentalism.

1928 Southern and Midwestern Democrats’ reject Al Smith for being wet, Catholic New Yorker.

1945 Dietrich Bonhoeffer, an advocate of “religionless christianity,” is executed by the Nazis. In the growing secularization after the death of God, religion ceases to play a significant role, with increasing separation of church and state, decreasing numbers of worshippers, and the individualization of religion.

1947 Carl Henry The Uneasy Conscience of the Modern Fundamentalist: reasserts biblical infallibility: God's revelations are the source of all truth, moral absolutes; all human thought must begin with presuppositions that cannot be proven but can be rationally defended.

1951 Paul Tillich Reactions to Barth: Barth overlooks the inherent linkage between humans and God: people are threatened by meaninglessness.

1953 Ludwig Wittgenstein, a traditionalist, posits that trust and community ground all forms of life, though he has suspicion of particular beliefs and practices rather than religion in general. He asserts conservative politics and fundamentalist religion as the right path.

1957 Sputnik alarms the US out of its narcotizing religiosity and denial of science.
1961 Flood Geology asserts that Noah’s flood caused geological layers.
1962 Engel v Vitale bans school prayer.
1963 Faced with the possible Soviet supremacy in space, the US updates its education with modern science textbooks.

The Religion of Politics or Politics of Religion

1967 Liberation theology brings out the political relevance of theology and rejects generalism; the church is not a fortress, but part of the city. The church is too closely associated with local elites; religion is used as an opiate for the poor. James Cone in A Black Theology of Liberation stresses the links between political and social liberation and God's work on the one hand, and complicity of the churches in oppressive sexism, racism, economic exploitation, wide gap between rich and poor, and Marxist views of the influence of material conditions upon consciousness on the other. Critics of this view cite a conflation of political liberation and Christian salvation.

Mary Daly: Liberation theology is a response to poverty, the evils of colonialism, and the failure of the first world to spark development.

Oscar Romero: Christian faith ought not to isolate us from, but rather immerse us in the world.

1970 Hal Lindsay’s The Late, Great Planet Earth suggests 1988 as the time of the Rapture.

1973 Roe v Wade legalizes abortion.

1974 Paul Ricoeur sees Barth's suspicion of religion's false comforts deepening the language of faith. He seeks suspicion to destroys idols and create space to hear the word of God.

1983 Rowan Williams: We need to recover elements of pre-modern traditions; ethics cannot be based in human reason; revelation, not reason is the shaping force in life. On Christian Theology acknowledges suspicion as a spiritual exercise: if we start from the human, we can't arrive at God; revelation allows us to break out of the liberal/fundamentalist dichotomy.

1968 Butler Act is ruled unconstitutional; Fundamentalists demand “Equal Time” to teach Creationism.

1980 Ronald Reagan champions Fundamentalism with the slogan, “Let’s Make America Great Again!”

1987 The Supreme Court determines that Creation Science is religious, strikes down Equal Time; the Fundamentalists now promote Intelligent Design.

1988 88 Reasons why the Rapture will occur in 1988 by Edgar Whisenant. He is wrong

1991 Gianni Vattimo : Secularization is a purification of religion, a trait of authentic religious experience.

1991 Stephen Carter The Culture of Disbelief: Religions are mutually exclusive: extra ecclesia nulla salus; The ideas of “God's chosen people” breeds intolerance. How can we function in a religiously diverse society? Secularism - people from all faiths or no faith engage on a level playing field. Strong secularism holds that public discourse should be free of religious language, but in that case, religion might be trivialized - the price of the compromise reached by the Founding Fathers. The US has had for the past 50 years a legal secularism in which the public sphere is strictly secular and religion deemed irrelevant to civil obligations.

1992 Daniel Dennett Breaking the Spell: We ought to study religion like any other mystical human phenomenon, remaining critical of those who believe in belief rather than God.

2000 Plantinga: Belief can be rationally justified without evidence if this belief serves as a properly basic belief.

~~~~~~~~

The End of Faith:

2004 Sam Harris asserts that religion is irrational,  causes violence, and refuses to acknowledge the truth of other religions. Harris is critical of the <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_right">Christian right</A> in politics in the United States, blaming them for the political focus on "pseudo-problems like gay marriage." He is also critical of <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Christianity">liberal</A>   <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Christianity">Christianity</A>—as represented, for instance, by the theology of <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Tillich">Paul Tillich</A>—which he argues claims to base its beliefs on the Bible despite actually being influenced by secular modernity. He further states that in so doing liberal Christianity provides rhetorical cover to fundamentalists. He proposes spirituality without religion.

2010 Jeffrey Stout Democracy and Tradition supports a weaker form of secularism that he terms “secularization” whereby religious people need not relinquish their beliefs; people with different backgrounds can come together in constructive interaction.

2016 Fundamentalists overwhelmingly support Donald Trump for President, not for his character or personal beliefs, but because they feel he will put them back in charge of the culture. David Brody, the host of “Faith Nation” on the Christian Broadcasting Network: “Does Mr. Trump have moral failings? Yes. Critics will suggest a hypocrisy coming from evangelical leaders who are quick to denounce the ethical failings of others who don’t have an “R” next to their name. But the goal of evangelicals has always been winning the larger battle over control of the culture, not to get mired in the moral failings of each and every candidate. For evangelicals, voting in the macro is the moral thing to do, even if the candidate is morally flawed. Evangelicals have tried the “moral” candidate before.”
