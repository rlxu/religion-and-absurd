      <strong>2004 Sam Harris</strong> asserts that religion is irrational,  causes violence, and refuses to acknowledge the truth of other religions. Harris is critical of the <A TARGET="_blank" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_right">Christian right</A> in politics in the United States, blaming them for the political focus on "pseudo-problems like gay marriage." He is also critical of <A TARGET="_blank" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Christianity">liberal</A> <A TARGET="_blank" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Christianity">Christianity</A>—as represented, for instance, by the theology of <A TARGET="_blank" HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Tillich">Paul Tillich</A>—which he argues claims to base its beliefs on the Bible despite actually being influenced by secular modernity. He further states that in so doing liberal Christianity provides rhetorical cover to fundamentalists. He proposes spirituality without religion.

      <strong>2010 Jeffrey Stout</strong> <i>Democracy and Tradition</i> supports a weaker form of secularism that he terms “secularization” whereby religious people need not relinquish their beliefs; people with different backgrounds can come together in constructive interaction.

      <strong>2016</strong> Fundamentalists overwhelmingly support <strong>Donald Trump</strong> for President, not for his character or personal beliefs, but because they feel he will put them back in charge of the culture. David Brody, the host of “Faith Nation” on the Christian Broadcasting Network: “Does Mr. Trump have moral failings? Yes. Critics will suggest a hypocrisy coming from evangelical leaders who are quick to denounce the ethical failings of others who don’t have an “R” next to their name. But the goal of evangelicals has always been <strong>winning the larger battle over control of the culture,</strong> not to get mired in the moral failings of each and every candidate. For evangelicals, voting in the macro is the moral thing to do, even if the candidate is morally flawed. Evangelicals have tried the “moral” candidate before.”
