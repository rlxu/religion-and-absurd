      <strong>Saul</strong>, who is a foil for David and Solomon, as alterations in the source material make clear.

    <span class="paragraph">
      <strong>David as King of All Israel:</strong> the lurid aspects in Samuel are largely ignored: the war between Saul and David, his adultery with Bathsheba, his murder of Uriah, the questionable circumstances of Solomon's birth, and the struggle for power between David's sons.
    </span>
    <span class="paragraph">
      <strong>David First Brings the Ark to Jerusalem</strong> to establish proper worship, at odds with 2Sam5-6, where David first defeats the Philistines and then rebuilds Jerusalem. After Uzzah's death for touching the ark, David orders that only Levites carry the ark, ascribing a liturgical practice from Chron’s own day to David’s.

      <strong>God’s Promises</strong> that David’s line will always be on the throne of Judah and that of forgiveness to Solomon form the two pillars of the theology of the returning exiles.

      David notices Bathsheba
    </span>
    <span class="paragraph">
      <strong>David’s Wars</strong> are successful when he trusts God. The Ammonite War is omitted, possibly because of David's adultery with Bathsheba, his murder of her husband, and implied illegitimacy of their progeny, Solomon.
    </span>
    <span class="paragraph">
      <strong>David’s Census</strong> at the urging of “Satan” (1Chron 21:1) displeases God and results in severe plagues. So who is "Satan" and why does he incite David? The Hebrew word <i>satan</i> means <i>adversary</i>. In Job and Zechariah, it implies a divine being, though not yet the dualistic personification of Evil of later Judaism and the New Testament, a concept that emerges during the Persian era. It seems best to interpret David's Satan as "a human adversary," perhaps a military threat. But then 2Sam24:1 states, “Again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he incited David against them, saying, 'Go, count the people of Israel and Judah'" Is God’s anger Satan? And what's so wrong with counting the people, anyway? Is it because apportioning Israel for taxation and conscription was a drastic change from long-held beliefs in Israel's tradition, or did David's numbering of the people arise from prideful assumptions about military might that led him away from trust in God?

      <strong>David</strong> has "shed much blood." And so <strong>commissions Solomon</strong> as the divinely chosen temple builder.

      <strong>David authorizes a Temple bureaucracy</strong> that only existed in the postexilic period.
    </span>
    <span class="paragraph">
      <strong>David Transfers the Kingdom and Charges Solomon</strong> (totally at odds with 1K1-2). There is no controversy over who will be king, no mention of Nathan, Bathsheba, or Adonijah. Solomon has no one killed and does not engage in the palace intrigues that occupy the initial chapters of 1 Kings. The repeated notice is only that God has <i>chosen</i> Solomon to rule Israel and build the temple.
