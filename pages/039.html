      Who leads the Jerusalem Church after Jesus’ sudden, violent  death? According to Acts, it is Peter, but Paul lists James prior to “Cephas” (Peter) and John as those considered "pillars" of the Jerusalem Church. Further, Eusebius records that Clement of Alexandria wrote that Peter, James, and John chose James, the brother of Jesus, as bishop of Jerusalem. As is made clear in his Epistle, James emphasizes Jesus’ doctrine of salvation by ‘works.’

      This epistle was specifically written to contradict Paul, who was then proselytizing salvation by faith alone. James and Paul also differed over whether to preach to Gentiles, widening the rift in the early church, as indicated in Galatians 2:9ff.
