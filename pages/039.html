      <strong>Who leads the Jerusalem Church after Jesus’ sudden, violent  death?</strong> According to Acts, it is Peter, but Paul lists James prior to “Cephas” (Peter) and John as those considered "pillars" of the Jerusalem Church. Further, Eusebius records that Clement of Alexandria wrote that Peter, James, and John chose James, the brother of Jesus, as bishop of Jerusalem. As is made clear in his Epistle, James emphasizes Jesus’ doctrine of salvation by ‘works.’

    <span class="paragraph">
      <A TARGET="_blank" HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-14/">2:14</A> What <i>doth it</i> profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him? <A TARGET="_blank" HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-15/">15</A> If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food, <A TARGET="_blank" HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-16/">16</A> And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what <i>doth it</i> profit? <A TARGET="_blank" HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-17/">17</A> Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone. <A TARGET="_blank" HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-18/">18</A> Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works. <A TARGET="_blank" HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-19/">19</A> Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well:  the devils also believe, and tremble. <A TARGET="_blank" HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-20/">20</A> But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead? <A TARGET="_blank" HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-21/">21</A> Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar? <A TARGET="_blank" HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-22/">22</A> Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect? <A TARGET="_blank" HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-23/">23</A> And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God. <A TARGET="_blank" HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-24/">24</A> Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only. <A TARGET="_blank" HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-25/">25</A> Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent <i>them</i> out another way? <A TARGET="_blank" HREF="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-2-26/">26</A> For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.

      This epistle was specifically written to contradict Paul, who was then proselytizing salvation by faith alone. James and Paul also differed over whether to preach to Gentiles, widening the rift in the early church, as indicated in Galatians 2:9ff.
