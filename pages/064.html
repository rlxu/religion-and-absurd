      <strong>1967 Liberation theology</strong> brings out the political relevance of theology and rejects generalism; the church is not a fortress, but part of the city. The church is too closely associated with local elites; religion is used as an opiate for the poor. <strong>James Cone</strong> in <i>A Black Theology of Liberation</i> stresses the links between political and social liberation and God's work on the one hand, and complicity of the churches in oppressive sexism, racism, economic exploitation, wide gap between rich and poor, and Marxist views of the influence of material conditions upon consciousness on the other. Critics of this view cite a conflation of political liberation and Christian salvation.

      <strong>1983 Rowan Williams:</strong> We need to recover elements of pre-modern traditions; ethics cannot be based in human reason; revelation, not reason is the shaping force in life. On Christian Theology acknowledges suspicion as a spiritual exercise: if we start from the human, we can't arrive at God; revelation allows us to break out of the liberal/fundamentalist dichotomy.

      <strong>1991 Stephen Carter</strong> <i>The Culture of Disbelief:</i> Religions are mutually exclusive: extra ecclesia nulla salus; The ideas of “God's chosen people” breeds intolerance. How can we function in a religiously diverse society? Secularism - people from all faiths or no faith engage on a level playing field. Strong secularism holds that public discourse should be free of religious language, but in that case, religion might be trivialized - the price of the compromise reached by the Founding Fathers. The US has had for the past 50 years a legal secularism in which the public sphere is strictly secular and religion deemed irrelevant to civil obligations.
