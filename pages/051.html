      St Augustine taught that error has no rights. He cited biblical texts to justify the use of compulsion, notably Luke 14:16-23. Had not Christ himself blinded St Paul in order to make him see the true light? According to Augustine, coercion using “great violence” was justified. He made a distinction between unbelievers, who persecuted because of cruelty, and Christians, who persecuted because of love. A war to preserve or restore the unity of the Church was a just war, a <i>bellum Deo auctore</i>, a war waged by God himself.
