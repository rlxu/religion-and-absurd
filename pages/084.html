      Jesus here gives a clear protocol for salvation; namely, to help those in need, even anonymously. This is in stark contrast to the criteria for salvation as given by Paul, which became the orthodox teaching; namely, faith in Jesus and baptism. Paul’s logic is that if doing good were enough to warrant entrance into the Kingdom of Heaven, then Jesus need not have died upon the cross, which is true: he didn’t need to die that way. Paul, however, was obsessed with the resurrection as the key aspect of Christianity. Thus Paul, on his own authority, subverts possibly the single most important teaching of Jesus.

      Mt 25:31 “When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: 25:32 And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall  separate  them  one  from  another,  as  a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats: 25:33 And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. 25:34 Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed  of  my  Father,  inherit  the  kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: 25:35 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: 25:36 Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me:

      I was in prison, and ye came unto me. 25:37 Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?  25:38 When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?  25:39 Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?  25:40 And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me. 25:41 Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels: 25:42 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink: 25:43 I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not. 25:44 Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?  25:45 Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me. 25:46 And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.”

      Jesus’ brother James, leader of the early Church, also emphasized the primacy of charity (good works), but at his death, church fathers chose Paul’s sacramental model based upon baptism and faith, because if random kindness is the key to salvation, one really doesn’t need a church.
