      <strong>1260 Thomas Aquinas,</strong> a sage of scholasticism, proves that authorities agree even when they don't. In the 14th century Realists (“reality is Platonic forms”) and Nominalists (“reality is what we sense”) challenge Aquinas’ argument that god is inscrutable.

      <strong>1431 Joan of Arc,</strong> born a peasant at Domremy in northeast France, is considered a heroine of France for her role during the Hundred Years’ War. Joan claims to have received visions of the Archangel Michael, Saint Margaret, and Saint Catherine of Alexandria instructing her to recover France from English domination. The unanointed King Charles VII reluctantly sends Joan to the Siege of Orleans as part of a relief army. She gains prominence when the siege is lifted only nine days later. Several additional swift victories lead to Charles VII's consecration at Rheims. This paves the way for the final French victory.
