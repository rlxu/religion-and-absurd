      Mark had no tradition of a sealed and guarded tomb, and the women came merely to dress the body, which is far more likely. Luke has the Apostles meeting Jesus in Emmaeus, a suburb of Jerusalem. The difference between Galilee and Jerusalem as the point of meeting may reflect tension between the Christians of Galilee (north) and those of Judea (south). ‘Extension’(MkX) refers to the continuation of the Gospel of Mark added during the Middle Ages. The original ends at Mark 16:8.

      The baptismal injunction seems to be from a post-Nicene orthodoxy. Mt 28:16 Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them. 28:17 And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted. 28:18 And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying,
