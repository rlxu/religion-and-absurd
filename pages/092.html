      Darkness from noon to 3:00 pm, reminiscent of the darkness over Egypt before the first Passover, was most probably added for dramatic effect, as were the sheeted dead emerging from their tombs. Based on his “Eli…” citation, Jesus apparently learned the Psalms in Aramaic. Elias (Elijah) was a prophet who did not die, but was taken up into Heaven by a chariot of fire, and would come to the aid of the distressed. Josephus has an account of an earthquake before the fall of Jerusalem in 70. Mt: John; Mk 14-15, John 18-19, died on different days. Note also that none of his followers was present, but only some women “beholding afar off.”
