      <strong>0539 Cyrus II captures Babylon -</strong> The Persian era will last until Alexander in 0332. Under Persia, the exiles are allowed to return from Babylon, rebuild the temple with the Zadokite High Priest as ruler, though many exiles stay in Babylon. The Persian era lays the foundations for the unified Judaic religion and the beginning of a scriptural canon.  The Davidic Zerubbabel is appointed Governor of Yehud, exciting Messianic hopes. Zecheriah: ‘He is chosen by god, redemption is imminent,’ and so he is relieved of his duties (and killed?) by the Persians.

      <strong>0515 The <A TARGET="_blank" HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Temple_period">Second Temple</A> is consecrated.</strong> The period is characterized by strict <A TARGET="_blank" HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotheism">monotheism,</A> the emergence of beliefs regarding <A TARGET="_blank" HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel">angels</A> and <A TARGET="_blank" HREF="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon">demons,</A> and the increasingly important institution of the synagogue. Yehud becomes a theocracy ruled by hereditary high priests, with a Persian-appointed governor, frequently Jewish, charged with keeping order and seeing that taxes are paid. The city is refortified, and Judean life is reformed. Biblical sources focus almost exclusively on highly Yahwistic exilic returnees, with no information on returnees before Nehemiah: it may have been more desirable to stay in Babylon, as Josephus relates, many were “unwilling to leave their property.”

      <p>Nehemiah Rebuilds the Walls of Jerusalem</p>
    </div>
    <span class="paragraph">
      <strong>0445 Nehemiah</strong>, Cupbearer to the Persian King, with the status of a Persian royal governor, on the order of Artaxerxes executes Jewish law, rebuilds the walls of Jerusalem, and demands a pure genealogy from those who wish to worship at the Temple. He brings strict Yahwism based on Deuteronomy, restores the Levites, enforces the Sabbath, and demands that foreign wives and children be sent away: Judaism is born, along with the Samaritan schism. Nehemiah also alleviates the exploitation of the poor, who were selling family members into slavery and were paying usurious interest on loans made contrary to the law, then he returns to Persian court to defend himself.These returnees, though they waited nearly one hundred years to leave Babylon, bear great disdain for those who stayed in Yehud, based partly on the exclusivism that the exiles developed while in Babylon and also partly on disputes over property.  But wait! Didn’t Nehemiah rule after Ezra? Not according to the times in office of the high priests: Eliashib under Nehemiah (Neh 3:1,20; 13:4), and Jehohanan under Ezra (10:6).

    </strong>0398 Ezra</strong>, part of the Babylonian Revival, returns to Jerusalem, has the Torah read. Under Ezra, Judaism becomes a religion of the book, with reading as important as sacrifice as an act of worship. Ezra may have been the first ‘rabbi,’ though he preached neither end of days, nor Davidic preference, nor blatant nationalism.

      <strong>0340 Samarian leader Sanbalat</strong> supports Alexander against Persia; Alexander is victorious, and so the Samaritan Joseph tribes (Manassah, Ephraim) are allowed to build a Temple on Mt. Gorizim (Nablus). Greek culture spreads with Alexander’s victory over Persia.
