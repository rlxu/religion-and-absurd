      It seems the gods of Canaan and likewise YHWH had a taste for blood. Reference to sacrifices:
    </span>
    <span class="paragraph">
      <strong>By neighboring peoples to their gods:</strong> Burnt offerings of children are documented to Moloch (Deut 12:31, 2Kings 23:10), the sacrifice of the first-born by Moab (2Kings 3:27)

      <strong>By Israelites to YHWH:</strong> Josiah  burns human bones to YHWH (1Kings 13:1-2, 2Chron 34:1-5), David sacrifices two of Saul’s sons and five of his grandsons to YHWH (2Sam 21:1, 8-14), a town and people are made a burnt offering to YHWH (Deut 13:13-19), YHWH kills all the first-born of Egypt (Ex 13:11-16), YHWH claims all the first-born of Israel as his (Ex 13:2), YHWH hands men over to be ‘fuel for the fire’ (Ez 21:33-37), YHWH demands Isaac be sacrificed (Gen 22:2), a city-full of people is offered as a sacrifice to YHWH (Josh 6:21), a thief is burned to death (Josh 7:15), Jephthah sacrifices his daughter as a burnt offering to YHWH (Judges 11:29-40), every devoted thing - both of man and beast - shall be put to death (Lev 27:28), Moses orders the murder of Midianite women and children (Num 31:25-40), YHWH gives statutes that the first-born are to ‘pass through the fire’ (Ez 20:25-26)
    </span>
    <span class="paragraph">
      <strong>By Israelites to other gods:</strong> Ahaz burns his son as an offering (2Kings 16:2-3), Manassah rebuilds altars to Baal and worships foreign gods, as had Ahab (2Kings 21:1-6), Israelites sacrifice their children to Moloch (Ez 16:20-21, 23:37, Is 57:5, Jer 7:31, 19:5, 32:35, Lev 20:2, Ps 106:37-41)

    <span class="paragraph">
      Also note that in all of these legends, the only important character is the male lead; the usually nameless wives and children are mere ciphers: Job’s original family, Lot’s wife, Lot’s daughter, Jephtha’s daughter, King Mesha’s son, Ahaz’s son, Isaac, the Innocents. Human sacrifice is disguised as a necessity, blood sacrifice is preferred (hence god’s preference for the offering of Abel), and of course, Jesus, whose sacrifice is memorialized by a daily cannibalistic ritual. ‘Without the shedding of blood, there is no remission’ (Heb 9:13-22).

      Indeed, the deaths of Job’s family are mere collateral damage of a wager between YHWH and Satan:
