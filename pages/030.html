      Greek-speaking Jews need a translation of the Bible into Greek, the Septuagint, in which certain liberties are taken: themes of the after-life are introduced; Proverbs is translated very freely; certain factual inconsistencies emerge: the enemies of Israel, who had been Aramaeans and Philistines are now Syrians and coastal Greek cities; words assume new meanings; there is a reluctance to refer to anthropomorphism - in Isaiah 38:11 ‘the Lord’ becomes ‘salvation,’ Exodus 24:10 ‘the Lord’ becomes ‘the place’; mistakes abound: Isaiah 7:14 ‘alma - young woman’ becomes ‘parthenos - virgin.’ This one error alone leads to millennia of creative theologizing). Some Jewish scholars contend that only the Pentateuch is translated under divine guidance, hence only those translations are accurate.

      One egregious example of rampant translation error is Isaiah Chapter Three, in which there are 41 translation errors. I have highlighted only a few verses below. My favorite is ‘transparent Spartan dresses’ for ‘crisping pins.’
