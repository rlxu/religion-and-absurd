      In Fundamentalism, three streams converge: those of Evangelicalism (Great Awakening), Dispensationalism (apocalypticism), and Princeton Theology (Biblical inerrancy), to assert five fundamental beliefs:

      1) inerrancy of the Bible,

      In socio-political terms, fundamentalism reflects dismay over: the loss of the old religion-based Anglo- Saxon order; the movement from an agrarian to an urban society; immigration by non-white, non- Protestants; higher criticism poking holes in the Bible; the collapse of western values during World War I; the rise of unions; the rise of women; the rise of minorities; and the spread of secondary schools exposing children to secular ideas and religious doubt.

      1916 Karl Barth’s Epistle to the Romans: The brutality of World War I causes a loss of confidence in modernism, and emphasizes God's transcendence. Barth agrees with Feuerbach that religion is ‘people talking about people.’ Barth prefers revelation - confession, acknowledgement of god's saving message. Much influenced by K, Barth asserts that God cannot be known, that religion is ultimately disbelief, that religion never gets beyond man to God, that religion is justification of ourselves, that theology is anthropology, that one should be suspicious of religion, that we should allow God to reach us through revelation, taken on faith. But trying to defend this confession is to acknowledge that humans can judge and explain God (uh-oh); one must read the Bible as the witness of God's revelation. On the left, he rejects Schleiermacher’s transcendence; and on the right, he rejects biblical inerrancy and total depravity. The bases of faith, however, he considers a priori.
