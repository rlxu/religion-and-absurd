      0928 BCE Solomon dies, and simmering conflicts split the country between the northern Ten Tribes: Reuben, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, Asher, Issachar, Zebulun, Joseph (split into Ephraim, Manasseh, and Machir [Manasseh east of the Jordan] ) and the four southern tribes: Judah, Levi (divested of land), Simeon (surrounded and assimilated by Judah), and Benjamin (conquered by Judah in 955). The most divisive issue between Israel (the northern ten) and Judah (the southern four) is the requirement that sacrifice to YHWH be performed exclusively by Zadokite priests at the Temple in Jerusalem. This policy effectively delists Shiloh, the location of the Tent of Meeting (Joshua 18:1), where the Ark of the Covenant had been kept, defrocks its Aaronite priesthood, and constitutes a declaration of religious war.

      The Hebrew Scriptures will be written by southern Judean scribes, who demand exclusive Yahwism (no gods but YHWH), and condemn Israel. Jeroboam, the Ephraimite head of Solomon’s forced labor operations, is proclaimed by Ahijah of Shiloh as YHWH’s “next man” (1Kings 11:29), who will become king of the northern tribes; he flees to Egypt until Solomon’s death.

      At Solomon’s death, the Assembly at Shechem is convened to crown Rehoboam. Leaders of the ten northern tribes ask Rehoboam if he intends to be as repressive as Solomon; Rehoboam responds that he will be worse: “My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke: my father also chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions." (1Kings 12:14).

    <span class="paragraph">
      The split is justified by the Judean editors of Scripture as punishment for Solomon’s failure to follow priestly exhortations; namely by marrying foreign wives and worshipping foreign gods. (1Kings 11:9-12):

    <span class="paragraph">
      “9. And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned from the Lord God of Israel ... 10 And had commanded him That he should not go after other gods…11.Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom away from thee and will give it to thy servant. 12 Notwithstanding in thy days, I will not do it for David thy father’s sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son."
