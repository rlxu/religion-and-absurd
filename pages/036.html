      are best summarized by the Sermon on the Mount with the Beatitudes and Antitheses:

      Jesus on love: <strong>‘Love your neighbor as yourself,’</strong> a sentiment already present in Leviticus. Also, in stark contrast to Nahum 1:2 ‘The lord takes vengeance on his adversaries (Gentiles) and rages against his enemies,’ and the beliefs of the Qumran sect that one should love certain people (our sect), hate everyone else (even Jews), Jesus proposes <strong>loving one’s enemies.</strong>

      Jesus also broke with convention by consciously <strong>associating with women and repentant sinners</strong> rather than with the proudly self-righteous; he preferred the attitude of sinful humility to that of smug spiritual superiority.

    <span class="paragraph">
      Regarding <strong>salvation,</strong> Matthew 25, discussed in greater detail below, is Jesus’ clearest doctrinal pronouncement. With its unambiguous endorsement of “works,” it directly contradicts later Pauline emphasis on “faith.”

    <span class="paragraph">
      Jesus was doubtless an <strong>Apocalypticist.</strong> The earliest sources - Q, Mark, M, Lk, and Paul - are all apocalyptic (cf, 1Enoch 69, Dan 7:13ff, Paul 1Cor 15:23, 1Thess 4:16ff, Mk 1:15, 8:38, 9:1!, 13:24ff, 13:30!, 14:62, Matthew 25:13; 19:28! (twelve thrones), Luke 17:24, 12:40). Apocalypticism was a widespread philosophical school in 1st century Palestine, which asserted that: the world is clearly divided between the powers of good and evil, that they then lived in an age of evil, that nothing can save the world except the direct intervention of God, that God’s intervention is imminent (Mk 9:1), that the beginning of God’s intervention will be signaled by resurrection of the good who suffered and the evil who inflicted suffering to face judgment. After it becomes evident that the Coming is not imminent, the message is changed: Mark 9:1 was toned down to Lk17:20. Then John 11:23 modifies it even further, saying that resurrection occurs whenever one had faith.
