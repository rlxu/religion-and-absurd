      1920 Freud: Religion is an illusion that helps us repress fundamental conflicts at the heart of our psychic life, the expression of our repressed desires in coded ways, originating in an Oedipal complex, with simultaneous love and hate for the Father. God is a form of wish fulfillment, a Father to whom we can express our love and who will forgive us for our hate; that is, our sin. Religion is a false consciousness hiding conflict between amoral pleasure and reality; it is a negotiation between the id and ego; it is a mass neurosis. Consciousness is shaped by repression of desire; civilization is built on coercion and renunciation. Religion is an effect of repression and the inability of humans to confront unavoidable psychic conflict.
